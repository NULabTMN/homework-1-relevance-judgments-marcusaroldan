          SECOND FOR BOSTON
          Babe Ruth.
          Babe Ruth, the Red Sox pitcher, is
          just about as valuable for his hit
          ting as for his pitching. Ruth has
          shown so much natural talent at bat
          that Bill Carrigan has seriously con
          sidered playing bim in the outfield

	      <text>Babe Ruth Is Lucky to Get Off So Easily After Hittimj Umpire
          FAR be It from ua to wish any guy haid luck, but It appears that Babo Ruth
          escftpefl too easily after his fight with Umplro Owens on tho ball field. Ban
          Johnson dismissed the matter with a flno of $100 nnd a suspension of ono week.
          This does not seem enough, nnd It Is certain that a player of less lmportanro
          would have been treated rather harshly. Ruth is one of tho stars of tho lcaguo .
          and a prolonged nbsenco would havo ruined Boston's pennant chances. Also tho
          gate receipts would have suffered. So Bnttllns Ban beenme as meek ns a lamb
          and decided to "give the boy another chance."
          The bad feature of this case Is that It will cnconrago others to pull tho same
          Btuff. A week's layoff nnd $100 fine Is nice, gentle punishment, nnd tho chances
          are that some playora would pay twice as much for a shot at nn umpire's Jaw.
          It cost McGraw $500 for punching Byron under tho grnnd stand nnd Ruth'a of
          fense was more flagrant thnn that. Ban seems to havo mado another mistake.
          Ho should, have used Ruth ns a horrlblo example and soaked him with a long
          layoff and a healthy tine.
          The dope has run to form at Pittsburgh. Barney Dreyfuss showed Jimmy
          Callahan the way to the gate nnd ho departed from tho city of smoke amid the
          crash and clatter of tho tlnwnro which was dragging behind. Callahan barf not
          made good with the Pirates nnd last year thero was talk of canning him. Ho
          is not popular with the players nnd they wouldn't work for him. Thls also was
          the case when Jimmy was boss of the Whlto Sox. His ability was great, but his
          personality negative.</text>

        <text>Ruth Pitches Red Sox to 1 to O Victory in First World Series Game
          Facts and Fancies
          ^^_By LOUIS LEE ARMS-_
          "Stuffy" Busted In .
          EARL HAMILTON, the left-hander who won six consecutive
          pames for the Pittsburgh Pirates this spring, and then en?
          listed in the United States Navy, used to Bay of "Stuffy"
          Mclnnis, then first baseman of the Philadelphia Athletics:
          "If a left-hander should place a baseball in a burglar-proof box
          and try to sneak it across the plate in the middle of the night he'd
          find 'Stuffy* Mclnnis there waiting to hit. There's one bird who lives
          in luxury off left-handers. He can hit anything they pitch."
          We observe that "Stuffy" broke it up yesterday.
          Vaughn passed Shean, Whiteman blew himself to a single and
          then Mclnnis. catching one of "Hippo" Vaughn's southpaw shoots,
          firmly laced it to left field for the single that scored Shean and gave
          the Red Sox the first game.
          It appears that this Beries is going to run to form.
          Victory Was Merited
          'fHE Cubs should have won, you say, but shoul dthey? In the first,
          1 third, and sixth innings they had men In scoring positions. A single
          would have scored two runs and beat the Sox in two of these innings;
          in the other the score would have been tied. But Pick, Paskert and
          Deal couldn't deliver the essential wallop when the time came. Base?
          ball is, more than anything else, a matter of doing the right thing at
          the right time. Mclnnis did that Pick, Paskert and Deal didn't.
          Ruth in the supreme test surpassed Vaughn, even though the pitching
          figures would indicate that Vaughn had the better of an exceedingly
          interesting duel. The assertion that Chicago should have won merits
          specific qualification.
          Ruth Is Boston's Ace
          THE Red Sox, always a "money team," are legitimately jubilant.
          At worst they will come back to Boston with one victory and two
          defeats. More of such excellent pitching and they will do better.
          Should they win two games and lose but one in Chicago they will be
          the long enders in whatever betting is done after the third game.
          But the jig isn't up with Chicago. Far from it. Vaughn meas?
          ured up to expectations and proved that the Sox do not relish first
          class southpaw pitching. Mitchell has Tyler in reserve and he can
          shoot Vaughn back in the third game if necessary. It remains to be
          seen if Bush or Mays, right-handers, can do as well against the. Cubs
          as Ruth did. Ruth is a great personality on a ball field. A giant in
          stature, resolute of purpose and with a wonderful "single-track"
          brain, re represents almost the ideal athlete for competitive effort
          under groat -Tain. Bush and Mays are not Ruth's equals in tem?
          perament. ,
          Fielding Rather a Surprise I
          THE fielding was a surprise. There were no errors, but neither
          were there hard chances. Chicago hit the ball into the air in the
          pinches and it is a bit early for any one to pull a Snodgrass. The
          Cubs' steck might have soared had the ball been hit on the ground
          and at one of Boston's "green" infielders. Likewise the Cubs ac?
          quitted themselves with honor in the field, but few of their plays,
          too, were made under strain.
          It is an old superstition that the team which wins the first game
          takes the series in this play. But it doesn't follow that there can't
          be exceptions to what has iUogically come to be regarded as a rule.
          The Sox met the rest best yesterday, but more of the Vaughn type
          of pitching and the Cur>s cannot fail to come through.</text>

        <text>Babe Ruth Hits 28th Homer,
          Ball Clearing Roof of Stand
          Longest Drive Ever Seen Under Shadow of Coogan's
          Bluff Ties Up Game in Ninth, but Yankees Come
          Through With a Winning Counter in Thirteenth
          By W. 0. McGeehan
          Babe Ruth, of the Boston Red Sox, broke all home run records at
          , the Polo Grounds in the ninth inning of the second game with the Yankees.
          His twenty-eighth home run for tho season cleared the top of the right field
          grandstand, the longest hit that was ever seen since the days when the
          goats roamed Coogan's Bluff and even before that. Numerically it places
          Ruth's home run record one beyond the twenty-seven achieved by Ed
          Williamson in 1884.
          The blow came in the ninth inning,
          with thfe Yanks leading by one run in
          a tight pitching duel between young
          Waito Hoyt and Bob Shawkey, of the
          Yankees. Ruth had been making des?
          perate efforts to break the record all
          afternoon and had been swinging wild?
          ly in his eagerness, lie was the first
          man up. and his huge frame was
          shaking with anxiety to swing his bat
          on something tangible.
          Tho first ball was high and wide,
          and Ruth let it go by with a scowl.
          The second one was a slow curved ball,
          and it drifted by the port side of the
          young giant about waist high. Every
          ounce of the huge frame went into the
          swing. Ho met the ball fairly, and it
          shot toward the roof of the grandstand
          with iuch speed that few could follow
          its course. It cleared the roof, and
          Ruth started to trot around the bases.
          Ball Sails Out of Lot
          High on the corner of the roof a
          i:?oy who hud gone up to furl the flags,
          waved his hands excitedly to indicate
          that the bal i had gone out of the sta?
          dium into the lot next door. The an?
          nouncer ran down the field to verify
          this' by word of mouth. Some years
          back Shoeless ?loe Jackson held the
          record for long hits at tho Polo
          Grounds. His hit landed in the space
          between the left field stands and the
          bleachers. . Ruth's hit went fairly out
          of the grounds, the first time that &
          ball has been driven out of the place
          since it was built.
          There is no way of measuring the
          exact distance of the hit, but the writer
          is willing to believe that it is the long?
          est distance ever covered by a batted
          ball. Ruth once hit for 5t?5 feet at
          Tampa, Fla., during a spring series.
          Bt ing cheated out of his record by
          Quinn in the first game seemed to
          make the Babe more furious. He
          whaled Bob the Gob viciously all tho
          way. In the sixth inning he drove tho
          ball out to the center field fence for
          a three bagger. He was travelling so
          rapidly in nis eagerness to turn it
          into a home run that he emulated the
          storied boner of Fred Merkle, for?
          getting to touch second and was called
          out.
          In th" twelfth inning Ruth came
          pretty close to making another home
          run. He got another of those slow
          curves anrb-drovo it out to far centre
          tiold. Chicle Fewster wa? leaning
          against the centre field wall when he
          caught the ball. It is not good to feed
          the Babo slow curves.
          "What kind of a ball did you pitch
          him?" they demanded in the press box
          after Ruth had crowned himself king
          and supreme monarch of all home run
          kings.
          "It was a slow curve," replied Robert
          moodily.
          Hoyt Makes Fine Showing
          If Ruth had not taken all of the
          limelight in that second game and for
          the entire afternoon, there would have
          been another Red Sox hero worthy of
          considerable space. The other niayer
          is young Waito Hoyt, the boy pitcher,
          who was first discovered by McGraw,
          Hoyt held tho Yankees hitless for nine
          inning- aftei they scored their first
          run. II?' nat only held them hitless
          '?ut he did not let a single one of therr
          reach first base, which.is some achieve?
          ment l'or a boy pitcher engaged in ?
          pitchers' duel with Bob Shawkey, one
          of the best, in the league.
          Hoyt got I.a- first pasting in the sec?
          ond inning. Wallie Pipp rolled one
          down toward first and beat it to th?
          bag, Pratt drove a long hit to left field
          sending Pipp to third anil taking sec
          ond on the throw-in. Duffy Lewis drove
          one to centre and scored Pipp. The*.
          the pitchers duel started in earnes
          and it was the tightest sort of garni
          until the ninth, when, as the playwrigh
          and Ring Lanier have observed, "Alonj
          came Ruth."
          Through tho twelfth itining younj
          Waite Hoyt, with the nonchalance of i
          veteran, continued to block the Yankee
          otT first base. The crash came in thi
          thirteenth. Walter Pipp came out o
          a batting slump and drove the ball al
          most to the ceutrefield wall. The offi
          cia.1 traffic cop of the Yanks pullei
          him up at third base. Pratt lifted a fl;
          to left, field and Phipp came home, end
          ing about as sensational a game as ha
          been seen in the lee of Coogan's Blul
          for many a day.
          Another sensational bit of work tha
          gets only mild nonce in tho dazzlin
          light of Ruth's achievement was
          throw made by Chick Fewster in th
          tenth. Gilhooley, with one out, drov
          a hit to deep centre. It certainl
          looked good for a triple with a man c
          Gilhooley's speed. But Fewster fielde
          tho ball smoothly and threw it t
          Baker, who gol the ball on the fin
          bound and tagged Gilhooley at tho ha?

          The sartorial sensation of the aftei
          noon was a high silk hat, about a fou
          quart ha', which made its way into th
          press box after the start of the secon
          game. It adorned the head of Eddi
          Gorman, the old battler who formerl
          was associated with the late .lohn ]

        <text>Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
          ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
          ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
          e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
          ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
          ;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
          ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
          ?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
          ra club unless his wishes are granted.
          . Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
          alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
          ?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
          oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
          Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
          e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
          Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
          '?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
          ?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
          The Joke of the sltuatioa is that
          tarry Frasee la In pretty much of a
          " ? He has established a precedent
          W Ruth to follow by trading Carl

          ubmarine funger grew tired of
          iking along with a losing club. So
          ar as Frasee ia concerned, he has
          ittlc argument to offer Ruth when
          'Bey ?ret together for a conference
          ?garehng this contract matter But

          This must be great reading for
          those misguided fools in Boston who
          presented Battering Babe with a $500
          diamoci at the close of the season
          a? an appreciation of his great work
          for the city. Some day the fans will
          a-et the rieht angle on what profes
          sional ball players think of them.

          of clothes and diamond stick pins.
          not to speak of watches and charms.
          The players take them-?sure, why

          May become a professional boxer.
          "Kid" McCoy, a former pugilist, and
          Al St. John, a motion picture actor,
          to-day entered into an agreement by
          which McCoy will train Ruth for
          thirty days and if his report was fa
          vorable St John would finance a
          campaign of the outfielder to obtain
          a match with Jack Dempsey, heavy-,
          woight champion.
          Ruth has given up plans to become

        <text>BABE RUTH PURCHASED BY YANKEES FROM RED SOX FOR $125,000?OTHER SPORTj
          Yankees Buy Babe Ruth
          From Boston for $125,000
          Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug
          ger From Hub City Team in Biggest Deal
          In History of Baseball.
          Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
          of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
          cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
          of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
          price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
          The deal was said to have involved no other players.
          Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
          information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
          ,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
          substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
          figure was not far from correct.
          Highest Figure Yet Paid.
          If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
          vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
          sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
          a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
          a player.
          When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
          Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
          player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
          given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.

          William II. Richardson, vie? pres
          ident and treasurer of the local base

          ton baseball club to be held at noon
          today.
          The new club member of the board

          baseball records by hitting twenty*
          nine homo runs. Ar.l this season
          there is every indication that ho will beat

          All these tilings doubtless have some
          thing to lo with it, but the real reason for
          thl:- iii.yionn'nal series of home runs sci
          i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to
          his work with the bat certain well-known
          principles of physics and psychology.
          "But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball plavor.
          What does ho know of physics or psy
          chology?"
          Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
          sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies
          certain well-known principles of these two
          sciences every time ho makes a homo run.
          Let us consider some of the many inter
          rsting scientific factors involved in bat
          t itig a ball.
          As  very follower of baseball knows, a
          home run is the knocking of the ball out
          of the reaoli of opposing players and in
          .r.uch a direction and to nuch a distance as
          o make its return impossil'o before th?
          runner completes the circuit of the bases.
          Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit
          ting of a home run moans simply hitting
          t)i< ball with the bat so as to give it great
          speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
          and direction which the bat can To made to
          give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
          curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
          the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
          of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
          bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
          pinges on the bat.
          The speed which a ball t * es on im
          mediately after its collision w'th the bat
          is a little difficult to compete because
          neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
          elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
          trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
          let mo explain what happens when per
          fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
          bodies come into collision.
          If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
          of lead?of equal weight and going with
          equal speed, but in opposite directions
          meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
          stop and fall to the ground, all theii
          energy of motion having been turned into
          heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
          of the same weight going with the same
          velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
          in mid-air, they will bounce back with
          the same velocity they had originally. 11
          one of these bodies has twice the velocity
          of the other, the latter will bounce back
          with twice its original velocity and tho
          former will bounce back only half as fast.
          All this applies to bodies having tho same
          weight. Whenever one of the colliding
          bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
          locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
          is enormously increased.
          The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
          the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
          tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
          the ball will be driven farther the heavier
          the bat and the faster the bat is moving
          as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
          "Halm" Ruth's body prevents his bat from
          doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
          ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
          hits it.
          The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
          important factor in hitting a homo run,
          viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

          were no atmosphere, everytliine be
          ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
          ho the farther it would go. The friction of
          the air. however, slows the ball up con
          siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
          into consideration with several others.
          The conclusion which science reaches Is
          that the heavier tho ball is, without In
          creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
          ticity, tho farther it will go after being
          struck with tho bat.
          The direction taken by a batted ball is
          affected to some extent by the rotation of
          tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
          is of the neatest importance when the
          but does not strike tho ball squarely.
          It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
          in such a way that it actually increases the
          latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
          fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
          ball in such a way that it takes on a de
          cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
          knows what a common occurrence this is
          on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
          dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
          weirdest imaginable path through the air,
          particularly if it passes through various
          air currents.
          A honr n depends to a very large ex
          tent up> ? direction given the batted
          ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
          he estimated a- nine times that of tho
          speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
          we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
          also the vertical angle at which tho ball
          leaves the hat. For example, no matter
          how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
          sult in a home run unit's ."t clears the
          upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
          field.
          It is plain that the direction given
          the butted ball must depend to a largo
          extent upon the manner in which the ball
          is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
          vided the ball is given a proper rota
          tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
          the kind of curve best suited to make it
          difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
          angle is either tho down shoot or the up
          shoot. On account of the many variablo
          factors concerned science believes that any
          home run made with either of theso curve3
          is a lucky chance pure and simple.
          After the ball has boon set in motion by
          the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
          it will go depends upon the vertical angle
          at which it starts. The most desirable
          angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
          or about half a right angle. Other factors
          which determine the distance a batted ball
          will travel are the speed of the ball, its
          sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
          and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
          speed of the ball tho more perfectly
          spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
          and the less rotation with which it travels
          the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
          ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
          A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
          free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
          it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
          its progress.
          If science wore asked to make it difficult
          or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
          Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
          tho barometer was high, with the air so
          heavy with moisture that it would retard
          the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
          pitcher selected would be one good on very
          alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
          pitcher were not available, one who hid
          euch great speed that lie couid put any
          kind of a ball over the plato for tho
          batter would bo chosen. With this
          hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
          be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
          started on its course at the proper angle.
          His hitting of a homo run could then bo
          mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
          redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
          heavy that he could not swing it with much
          speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
          tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
          There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
          ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
          ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
          knows as the centre of percussion. If the
          ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
          greatest effect is produced. All ball play
          ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
          on the bat, not only through the absence
          of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
          iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
          but which is no doubt physical as well as
          mentnl.
          "Babe" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
          ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
          sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
          way of producing the collision between
          his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
          cussion more frequently than any other
          player.
          What is called the centre of percussion
          is a principle that enters into the design
          not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
          designed for men to swing. In the ham
          mer, for example, the centre of percussion
          should be in the head. If the tool is not
          designed so that this centre is properly
          located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
          use because it jars and tires tho am too
          much.
          The problem of hitting homo runs with
          the surprising frequency that "Babe" Ruth
          does is ono more complicated in the mat
          ter of powers of Judgment and observa
          tion involved than in mechanical prin
          ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
          tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
          as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
          to bo given a motion as fast as possible
          when hitting the ball, and striking the
          ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
          air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
          grees or half a right angle. The ball
          should also, of course, be hit at such a
          horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
          T^lio weight of the batter has very little
          to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
          arm muscles are a controlling factor to
          the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
          If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
          bat for all practical purposes a part of his
          body when he hits the ball, and if his body
          is swung forward at just that instant, it
          Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
          things being equal, would be able to knock
          the ball farther than a lighter player.

          To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
          hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
          often travelling at the rate of lf>0 feet
          a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
          The eye movement necessary to follow it
          increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
          and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
          crease in the angle of vision which, by the
          time the ball is over tho plate, is about
          ten times what it was when it left tho

          than that when it leaves "Babe" Ruth's bat
          after being hit for one of tho home runs
          that have made him famous. This is in

          tion by throwing a ball
          ngainst n brick wall. Tho
          faster it travels, tho hard
          , er it hits tho wall and tho
          farther it will bounce
          back.
          Of courso, If it Is raining
          when one of "Babe" Ruth's
          long hits is made, the
          drops of water striking tho
          ball will bring it to the
          ground long before it
          otherwise would fall. Tho
          rain also makes the ball
          heavier, and as It contains
          only so much energy to
          k start with, it will bo
          \ slowed up in its flight on
          account of some of tho
          L?rIL.? energy being used to give
          tho captured rain drops
          their new velocity.
          flow much actual energy does "Babe"
          Ruth expend in hitting one of his home
          fns? Tho activity or horsepower involved
          1* very great, but it is in operation only
          for tho" fraction of a second.
          The ball which "liabe" Ruth hits for a
          V e run weighs about tivo ounces. If
          n % at gives it a velocity of 500 feet a see
          on.., wo find, by applying a well known
          formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
          of actual energy or work is done. Now,
          if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
          to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
          this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
          pounds a second, which is about forty-four
          horsepower.
          Tho king of homo run makors Is then
          working at tho rate of forty-four horse
          power evory time ho cracks out one of hla
          long hits, but he maintains this rate for
          such a brief length of time i.hat not very
          much actual work is involved.
          Hut if the energy exerted by "Babo'
          The Horse-Power Required to Make Fifty of
          "Babe" Ruth's Home Runs Would Be Suffi
          cient
          Ruth In all the homo runs he has made
          up to (lato coulil ho collected into a singlo
          forco it would he a vory enormous thing.
          Twenty-nine such runs last season and
          moro than a score thus far this year?
          this would he the equivalent of more than
          2,000-horsepower?enough if exerted bo
          hind a gigantic bat to demolish a building
          like Now York's Metropolitan Tower!
          Of course, there are many psychological
          as well as mechanical factors involved in
          the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
          which "Babe" Ruth has been making for
          two seasons. The batter must bo able to
          "sense" in some manner not yet fully un
          derstood just about what kind of ball the
          pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo
          capable of putting his body in readiness
          with lightning swiftness to meet that kind
          of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
          player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
          made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
          ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
          Through some queer sixth sense?tne
          kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
          ?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
          the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
          ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
          average batter the impressions conveyed
          by this sixth sense caunot be more than (50
          per cent accurate, but in the case of "Babe"
          Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
          must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
          everybody who plays baseball or ever
          watches a game knows, you can't strike out
          and make a homo run. and the player can
          seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
          strikes is taking a course that would havo
          carried it straight across the plate unless
          Interrupted by his bat.
          This, then, is the secret of "Babe"
          Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
          tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
          aesthetic sense enables him to "sense" the
          kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
          When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
          n.\is and curving most favorably for his
          purpose comes along he swings his bat at
          it with an energy sufficient to chango its
          direction and greatly increase its velocity.
          The bat Is swung in such a way that the
          centre of percussion meets the ball, send
          ing it upward at an angle of 42 degrees
          and not too far to the right or the left.
          When all these things happen the result
          should bo a home run, provided that the
          pitcher has given the ball proper speed
          and that tho wind and other atmospheric
          conditions aro favorable.</text>

        <text>"Did Babe Ruth Get Another One To-day?"
          | Not "How Did the Game Come Out?"
          *| Now the Great American Question 4
          By W? O. McGeehan
          IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
          peare were a' baseball writer he
          might usa a line that he
          wested upon some more or less
          obscure hero of antiquity and say of
          "Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
          narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
          sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
          and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
          of Swat. His bat is the club of
          Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
          the symbol of sheer, primitive might
          before which the puny folk bow and
          offer worship.
          But for the game of baseball, the
          youngest game of the youngest peo?
          ple, George Herman Ruth, the
          "Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
          personalities in the daily news,
          might have been a peaceful cigar
          maker or perhaps a third-rate
          heavyweight pugilist instead of the
          national idol of the American people.
          The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
          ling, though Fortune concealed her
          great and kindly intentions as far as
          he was concerned when the "Babe"
          was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
          born left-hander!. Hercules was a
          right-hander. Thor never was pic?
          tured as wielding his hammer from
          the port side. None of the heroes of
          antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
          tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
          Wilson was the first novelist to put a
          left-hander in the near-hero class,
          and he i;d it in a half-hearted
          fashion.
          Moreover, little George Herman
          Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
          early age and was sent to an insti?
          tution for orphans. He was nearly
          an orphan boy, and, according to
          the San ford and Merton books, he
          should have taken a morbid sort of
          point of view at an early age and
          learned something useful. But the
          youth of "Babe" Ruth was applied
          mostly to the study of the great
          American game of baseball.
          You are not going to draw any
          conventional moral from the early
          boyhood of "Babe" Ruth. He was
          not a particularly industrious or
          thrifty lad, chockful of conventional
          virtues. He was just a normal,
          chuckle-headed combination of Tom
          Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
          Was Just natural and just human.
          FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
          "Babe" Ruth was intrusted to
          men who understand human
          nature, and particularly the human
          boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
          timore. The fraternity is not limited
          to Baltimore. It is all over the
          *orld. It is made up of big-hearted
          ?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak
          lfig men out of the raw material.
          They had charge of the bringing
          UP of George Herman Ruth and
          They have turned over to the world
          ??Colossus of Swat. It is due to
          th*ir human understanding that
          George Herman Ruth was not
          wwarted and turned aside into more
          Wo**ic iine8 0f encjeavor,
          U?Kt lana&tiQ than ?sqr *rf fbe
          I boy romances of Tattered Tom and
          Ragged Dick, by Horatio Alger jr.
          ; is the rise of "Babe" Ruth. The Al-,
          | ger heroes became mere bankers or
          traction magnates, but George Her
          | man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
          came "Babe" Ruth, at whose shrine
           bankers and traction magnates burn
          incense. Ever and anon these jaded
          near-successes pick up the tape, not
          to see the condition of the market,
          but to learn whether the latest is the
          forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
          ! knocked out by the "Babe" for the
          I season.
          And these heroes envy "Babe"
          ! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
          ! was regarded as far from bright in
          ;his classes. For the "Babe" can hit
          them out with the joyous freedom of
          Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
          throwing his hammer through the
          clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
          are vain when he faces them, and all
          the walls of the baseball parks are
          lowered when his bat crashes against
          the baseball. Homer would have
          loved him if the blind singer had had
          a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
          THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
          ter of them all is admitted by
          two members of the old Orioles;
          and when two members of the old
          Orioles agree upon anything, that
          makes it official and irrefutable. If
          there is anybody so ignorant of im?
          portant American history that he
          does not know who the old Orioles
          are, we will explain, more in pity
          than in indignation, that the old
          Orioles were members of the great?
          est baseball team of a generation or
          so ago.
          The two Orioles who made the ad?
          mission that "Babe" Ruth was the
          greatest baseball player in the whole
          world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
          ger of the Brooklyn National League
          baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
          scout for the Yankees. Both of these
          gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
          zens of high repute in the city where
          they dwell, which also happens to i
          be the home of "Babe" Ruth. Wil-1
          bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
          ; holds the world's record for consecu?
          tive base hits in one game. Joseph
          Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
          the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
          cupation is "ivory hunting," looking
          upon baseball playera and appraising
          them ?at their true > jrtb to their
          employers and to the national pas?
          time.
          These two authorities admitted" to
          me in th? presence of witnesses that
          never, even in the days of the old
          Orioles, was there a baseball player
          who could hit like "Babe" Ruth. Con?
          sider the importance of this admis?
          sion. The members of the old Ori?
          oles are the most conservative per?
          sons in th vorld. Never before
          have they au. : ..ed that any player
          of the present was anywhere near as
          wonderful as tl\e players of their
          glorious day.
          "He can hit them harder than any?
          body, and he can hit them oftener,"
          they admitted from the fullness of
          their hearts. They did not qualify
          the statement, They did ?ob assert
          that the pitchers were less canny
          and that the ball parks were smaller.
          They admitted that the heroes of
          their day were lost in the shadow of
          the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
          that even in the days when the old
          Orioles were young "Babe" Ruth
          would have loomed up above them
          all.
          That Ruth broke all big league
          records for home run getting last
          year is in the book. That he has
          broken his own record this year and
          is on the way to setting a mark far
          beyond the misty horizons ?if the
          baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
          old Orioles have explained away the
          performances of other more modern
          heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
          ments they Jr&ott ungrudgingly.,
          That is almost as marvelous as the
          achievements themselves.
          .
          ONCE upon a time the youth of
          this land worshiped another
          young giant, a right-hander
          and an exponent of another and el?
          der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
          right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
          mighty in its day, but the left arm i
          of "Babe" Ruth is mightier in its I
          day and generation in the matter of
          sheer numbers of worshipers.
          | They used to block the corridors
          of the hotels, and even the streets,1
          ? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
          do that in the case of "Babe" Ruth,
          I too. It is not for me to disparage
          | the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
          | gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
          -?
          ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
          mirers saw that particular John L.
          through rose glasses and that they
          worshiped an illusion.
          The John L. Sullivan of the later !
          day, the John L. who beat down his ?
          own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
          self-respect from the muck, was the
          John L. that should have been wor- ;
          shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
          was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
          L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
          tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
          the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
          and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
          John L. who conquered himself was i
          the true fighter.
          But we are considering the John L.
          that was the popular idol, the '
          brawny man who was followed by '
          the men and the boys and cheered
          when he stalked abroad. He was !
          not a particularly affable character.
          This big "Babe" Ruth is a far
          more likable person. He is full of i
          good nature and the joy of living.
          He is a modest enough young man, :
          and he knows his limitations, though ;
          he acknowledges no limitations as j
          far as the baseball diamonds and j
          the fences around them are con
          cerned. He is not falsely modest to
          the point of affectation, for he has
          that supreme confidence in himself
          that comes after certain achievement.
          But he will not play to the gallery
          consciously. He likes the gallery
          and he understands it, and he likes
          to have it understand him. ?
          Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
          it may be too wise, to try to fool his
          gallery, as other stars of his own ;
          game or stars in other lines of en?
          deavor have tried to do in vain. For
          nobody can fool his gallery. No
          truly wise man ever tried.
          THE best judges of a man ar?
          the men with whom he works !
          or with whom he plays.
          "Babe" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
          est salaried ballplayer on the New
          York Yankees. He might, if he were
          like some of the stars of baseball or i
          stars of some of the arts, claim all
          the privileges of a star and hold
          himself aloof from his fellow players.
          Here again is the simplicity or the
          wisdom of "Babe" Ruth. He plays
          the game with the team and for the
          team, and the men ' he plays with
          know it and appreciate it. "Babe'
          Ruth will even make the "college
          try" to get a base on an impossible
          chance. The "cdllege try" is the vet?
          eran professional's term of contempt
          for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
          tile on the facts of it.
          _ an the "Babe" *nake?th? two
          owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
          Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
          apprehension when he hurls himself
          against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
          when he throws his huge bulk
          through the air in the effort to steal i
          a base. They rejoice in his spirit
          and his wholehearted way of play?
          ing, but at the same time they per?
          spire with apprehension lest some?
          thing should happen that would de?
          prive them of the most expensive in?
          vestment in professional baseball.
          Some stars have disrupted base?
          ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
          "Babe" Ruth, admittedly the great?
          est star of them all, has made the
          Yankees a team. The advent of the
          "Babe" has brought them the chance
          of that "world's scries dough," which
          should be something like $7,000 a
          player. It has also made them the
          team of the big leagues. They do not
          begrudge the "Babe" the homage
          that is paid him. As far as Ruth
          is concerned, there is no professional
          jealousy on the Yankee team.
          Just to what extent the present
          prosperity of professional baseball
          is due to "Babe" Ruth I would not
          care to say, but it is considerable
          When I first trailed West with tht
          Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
          that there had been little or no in
          tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
          I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
          they turned out to the extent of 20,
          000 a day and upward to see the
          "Babe" "bust one."
          Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
          eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
          the Chicago pitcher passed "Babe"
          Ruth. Ten thousand people started
          to walk out of Comiskey Park.
          There remained yet the chance of
          the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
          but the ten thousand had lost all
          interest in the game for the after?
          noon. It was clear thatr they were
          not going to see "Babe" Ruth knock
          a home run, and nothing else mat?
          tered.
          Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
          terest in the national game were
          minor considerations. The "Babe"
          was not due to "bust one."
          IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
          to two tired business men early
          in the afternoon.
          Said one of them gravely:
          "This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
          is responsible to a large degree for
          i the lack of production in these
          : manufacturing towns around the
          Lakes. Go out to the ball park to?
          day and you will see thousands of
          young men taking the afternoon off
          just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

          lonuvKt of the three1, approaching

          However, long afl the Babe's hit was.

          But, In achlltlon to the length of
          thM blow, tho day was otherwise full
          on glory for George Herman. It was,
          ,uUia3 been said, the second homemin
          ho .had got during tho game. It was
          thin fourth ho had got In two days and
          tho day's clouting made the fifth
          day in succession that he bad knocked
          out homers. ' Ho started last Fri

          !hlti another Saturday off Mlddleton of
          tho Tigers, another Sunday off Suth

          Ehvnke and two yesterday off Dalies
          dewen altogether In live days, to
          Hay -.nothing of hitting four in succes
          sion. A.1bV It was bis twenty-third four
          base U'ow of the season, and tho 126th
          of his .major league career, exceeding
          tho liftVlme big league record of Cac
          tus CrtAyath by five. And tho Babe
          still a comparative youngster!
          Incidentally, the Yankees made it, by
          the score- of 9 to 6, a clean sweep,
          four in a ran', off Ty Cobb's Tigers.
          Ty, who had been In somewhat of
          an eclipse, slammed a homer across
          In the sixth 'Oft Rip Collins, but there
          was no one on a base, while Roger
          Pocklupaugh was on each tltno the
          Babe hit his.

          After slamming his two homers In
          tho llrst two times at bat, the Babe
          In tho fifth swung mightily but glanc
          Ingly, and grounded weokly to Dauss,
          making an easy out at first.

        <text>"BABE" RIJTH'S SALARY
          "Babe Ruth," baseball star, is to receive a
          salary of seventy-five thousand dollars this year,
          with an additional five hundred dollars for every
          home run he bats out. On the basis of his last
          season's record this should bring his income for
          the coming eight, months' work up to well over the
          hundred thousand dollar mark.
          To many this will seem arf^rtjtf^Sbe. Thej^-will
          point out the fact that the President of the United
          States draws only seventy-five thousand dollars a
          year that the Secretary of State gets but twelve
          jthousand that the salaries of most of our gover
          in&rs and college'presidents average around ten
          thousand dollars a year. These are vocations that
          require years of training, of research, and the
          hardest kind of work.
          Yet, along comes a baseball swatter with no
          special intelligence, and gobbles up a salary great-: h^f^I VutyT
          er than that attached to the greatest office in the
          land.
          Critics of "Babe" Ruth's salary should not for­
          get that thley are living in America. This is a
          j.free land and it offers opportunity for advance
          jment to every citizen. What better proof is need­
          ed than these very facts albout "Babe" Ruth. An
          orphan, with no parents to guide his steps and yet
          with all his handicaps he is raised to the seats of
          the mighty,' with a salary that exceeds those of
          the mighty.
          It cannot be luck. Ruth 'has specialized. He
          has trained. He has made himself the ibaseball
          swat king of America. His name is known from
          coast to coast. His admirers are legion.
          America cannot cry down the salary "Babe"
          Ruth gets. His work is measured by his follow­
          ers, and it is the people who indirectly pay him.
          He is the best in his field. America offers sim­
          ilar opportunities in every line to every citizen,
          and should not be afraid to boast of it. As Emer­
          son so aptly put it a generation ago:
          "If you can make a better mousetrap than your
          neighbor, the world will make a beaten pathway
          to your door."—Minneapolis Journal,</text>

        <text>BABE RUTH LIKELY TO DRAW PENALTY FOR EFFORT TO PROTECT HIMSELF
          WASHINGTON TIMES SPORTS
          FRIDAY, MAY 26, 1922.
          F
          Suspension Likely for Ruth,
          But Incident Draws Attention
          to Fans' Cowardice.
          By lolls A. HOLGHKR.
          Babe Ruth is likely to he pun
          ished severely for entering the
          grandstand at the Polo Grounds,
          New York, and seeking to ham
          mer an insulting fan. There are
          two sides to every question and
          the ball player has an excellent
          argument to offer in partial pal
          liation of his offense.
          Ban Johnson is expected to sus
          pend the Yankees' home-run hit
          ter for ten days. He may impose
          a heavy fine on the player. But
          Ban Johnson will do the game a
          great good if he will investigate
          conditions surrounding the inci
          dent at the Polo Grounds.
          It Is admitted that Babe Ruth
          ov?rratepped the hounds on the play
          ing field when, called out stretching
          his single, he tossed a handful of
          dirt at Umpire Hildebrand. He wps |
          ejected from the game for that, then ?
          and there.
          It is admitted that Ruth commiited
          a cardinal offense when he lef< the I
          playing field and sought to beat up |
          one of his insulters. He is vet to.
          be punished for that.
          Nevertheless\ Bah* Rulli and |
          every other player In ihe ma.ntr
          leagues is entitled io prole? limi
          from insult and injury on the par!
          of the public. It is all tnirutivrnt
          for a club owner to say he cannot
          stop the Rood of villifi? at ion such
          as we heard shouted at Rulli yes
          terday snd Wednesday.
          ?
          Babe Ruth is a young man. He ?
          la lio better anil no worse ih.in any
          ?ther man.
          Babe Ruth, because he can hit I
          home runs, has been raised on a
          pinnacle extending wcllnigh lo tho ?
          skies. If it has turned his h?ed. |
          there ia good reason.
          Babe Ruth, be? atise he has not *
          been hitting home runs in every !
          game since his return to the New
          Tork lineup, ha? been the tarnet ;
          for Insults shocking to one not ac- I

          For Ruth's Wild
          Deed on Field
          CHICAGO, May 26.?"I am
          sorry to hear that," waa the
          comment of Ban Johnson,
          American League president,
          when informed that Ruth had
          kicked over the traces in yes
          terday's Yankee-Senator game
          at the Polo Grounds in New
          York.
          Johnson was unable to say
          what action .he would take in
          the matter. He will be guided
          by what Umpires Nallin and
          Hildebrand have to say in their
          telegraphic reporta of the af
          fair.
          insult rose to Its height In the
          seventh Inning .when Ruth fail???! to
          hit safely, with two out and the
          bases loaded.

          Ruth committed a cardinal offense
          when he climbed Into the ?tauri.
          Those fans make It possible for
          him to be the highest-paid liall
          player in the business.. Without
          those fans, there would be no bute
          ball played at all, save as a matter
          of exercise.
          if Ruth were an ancient phil
          osopher, he might sit down, swallow
          his chagrin at the turn ln the tide
          and wait for better days. But Ruth
          is a young man. a professional
          athlete raised in one season to the
          heights of popular success. He Is

          ponder on the fate of great gen

          Ruth is undergoing such experiente

          similar insults, rushed into th?? |

        <text>I’ve never yet won an Academy Award in
          all my years as an actor. But I wouldn’t
          swap the memory of my performance at
          Yankee Stadium on Sunday, May 9,1948, for
          all the Oscars in Hollywood, even though not
          a single drama critic was on hand to hail it.
          When Allied Artists tapped me to star in
          "The Babe Ruth Story,” a lot of Hollywood
          wise guys looked at each other with knowing
          glances. I think Allied Artists even glanced
          knowingly at itself. For one thing, I wasn’t
          a ballplayer. I had played a pretty passable
          outfield as a kid in school, but I didn’t look a
          bit like Ruth in action. I was a long way from
          being a ringer for him in appearance. Nature
          hadn’t endowed me with either his balloon
          ing midriff or his spindly, toothpick ankles.
          10
          Baseball is full of surprises, but this
          one topped them all. The 35,000 fans at
          Yankee Stadium couldn't believe their eyes
          By William Bendix
          Star of NBC-TV’s “Life of Riley ” Program
          But there was one asset I did have for the
          role and Allied knew it: I was a Babe Ruth
          worshiper from way back. As a kid in New
          York I had put in a long stretch as locker
          room boy and bat boy for the Yankees.
          When Babe Ruth’s stomach growled from
          hunger which was about once per inning
          I was the lucky kid who ran to get his hot
          dogs. He was the hero I wanted to be when
          I grew up.
          My huddle with the producers the day they
          sounded me out about' playing Babe Ruth was
          more like a major-league contract discussion
          than a casting meeting.
          "Can you hit?” they asked.
          "I may be able to come through with a few
          Texas Leaguers.” I told them. My throwing
          was weak and my fielding spotty, I had to
          admit. But Allied Artists had only two alter
          natives: make an actor out of Babe Ruth, or
          a hitter out of me.
          The decision to try the latter course soon
          led to a complete repeal of the old proverb,
          practice makes perfect. Practice made me
          lousy and while the directors wrung
          their hands I got blisters on mine. The
          best I could wangle was an occasional
          dribble to the pitcher's box.
          "Okay, Bill,” director Roy Del Ruth (no
          relation to the Babe) said to me one day.
          "Just swing and try to look good. We’ll use
          camera tricks to fake the home runs. The
          sound-effects man will supply the crack of the
          bat and the cameramen will show a ball
          dropping into the right-field stands.”
          Even taking a convincing cut at the ball
          was tough for me because, to {day Babe Ruth,
          I had to learn a complete new stance: I had
          to learn how to swing left-handed.
          The labs Arrives
          A few weeks after the shooting of the film
          began, the Babe himself got up out of a hospi
          tal bed and arrived, ailing and haggard, in
          Hollywood to coach me in his pigeon-toed
          batting stance. His tutoring helped me bran
          dish the bat with a swaggering air and glare
          menacingly at the pitcher. But it didn’t lift
          my batting average much above zero.
          In May. 1948, a skeleton crew and part of
          the cast came East to film the final scene in
          Yankee Stadium. The background for this
          shot was to be as authentic as possible. It was
          to immortalize one of baseball's greatest
          moments Babe Ruth's sixtieth home
          run in 1927, which established an all
          time record for a single season.
          To assure a banner crowd we announced in
          the newspapers that an important scene for
          • The Babe Ruth Story” would be filmed before
          the start of Sunday’s Yankee-White Sox game.
          Conditions at the ball park were an exact
          replica of Ruth’s red-letter day in 1927. There
          were 35,000 fans on hand. The team in the
          field, dressed in Washington Senator uniforms,
          consisted of semi-pro players hired by the
          studio. The pitcher I had to face was no semi
          pro: he was Lefty Gomez, one of the game’s
          greatest hurlers, who had retired a few years
          earlier. He was playing the role of Tom
          Zachary, the Washington southpaw who had
          actually tossed the ball Babe Ruth had lam
          basted for No. 60.
          As I strode to the plate, feeling like an
          inept impostor. Mel Allen made the following

          .CHICAGO, April 7.— Chicago is again
          In the throes of a struggle between
          capital and the labor union*. As on
          former occasions the unions have re
          sorted to the use of the union teams
          ters to bring them victory in the
          struggle, which tonight promises to
          spread to many branches of the team
          ing. Industry of Chicago.
          The present struggle had Its begin
          ning In a strike several months ago of
          a few hundred garment workers em
          ployed in the mall order house of
          Montgomery Ward & Co. The closed
          shop la the Issue and In order to bring
          the firm to the terms of the union a
          strike of the 200 drivers and teamsters
          employed by the concern was called
          today.
          .As has always been the case In the
          past when the teamsters were called
          mi to Hsslst. by a sympathetic strike,
          the down-town streets of Chicago to
          day were scenes of disorders which
          followed fast on each other when an
          attempt was made to deliver goods
          with non-union drivers. Many teams
          ters, garment workers and their friends
          filled the streets and many clashes
          with the police occurred. In several
          Instances It was necessary for the po-
          Illce to arrest a number of the belliger
          ents j before the blockades could be
          lifted.
          May Involve Twenty Thousand Drivers
          '-'In the belief of many labor leaders,
          today's strike is the beginning of a
          great contest 1 that may involve 20,000
          drivers. •
          The move against Montgomery Ward
          & Co. is an opening wedge by which
          teamsters hope to bring success to the
          garment workers in an effort to es
          tablish a closed shop. There are twen
          ty-eight employing clothing makers in
          the city and it is the purpose to ex-
          I tend the teamsters' * Strike gradually
          until It Includes all of the twenty-eight
          firms. ('_■.. l '?!. : J;^:l
          JThe indications are that the strike
          will-n ot stop even then, but will in
          volve many other branches of the
          teaming industry.

          tanced his pursuers.
          I ,'John Olson, a licensed expressman,
          was less fortunate than Feder's man
          ager. Olson, after delivering four
          ' boxes of goods, was set upon by the
          pickets, who climbed to the seat and

          Should Mot be Brought to Chicago

          Swell Sew
          The great teamster's strike in this
          city is at fever heat, and at the present
          writing it seems it will be a death
          t niggle between the teamsters, the
          business men or the capitalistic
          classes, at this time we will not at
          tempt to discuss any other phase of
          this bitter class struggle between
          capital and labor, except as it effects
          the- law abiding colored people those
          who will continue to reside in this
          wonderful city after the strike has
          lieen lost or won either by the team
          sters or by those who are opposing
          them.
          It is the opinion of the vast major
          ity of the better class of colored peo
          pie residing in all parts of Chicago,
          that the managers of the Employer's
          Teaming Company are not justified in
          bringing hundreds ad hundreds of col
          ored men here from the remote parts
          of the South many of them repre
          senting the lowest and the toughest
          element of the race, who are armed
          to the teeth and are ready to shoot any
          person on the slightest provocation,
          to temporally serve as strike break
          ers, for such Negro hating concerns
          as Marshall Field and Company, Man
          del Brothers, and Montgomery Ward
          and Company who have no use for
          Negroes in general except to use them
          as brutish clubs to beat their white
          help over the head so that they will
          Low or knuckel down to them in all
          things.
          Every intelligent colored man and
          woman residing in or near Chicago
          are aware of the fact that for years
          past Marshall Field and Mandel
          Brothers have absolutely refused to
          IK-rmit colored men or women to work
          in their stores even as cuspadore
          cleaners, and any Negro who will
          spend his money in their stores or
          work for them 'simply as a strike
          breaker, is an enemy and a traitor to
          his race.
          Marshall Field and Company. Man
          del Brothers, Montgomery Ward and
          Company and the other firms who are
          engaged in bringing many colored
          men here from the South to serve
          them for the time being like so many
          servile and abject slaves have by
          their actions proven themselves dis
          honest in this respect, for if they were
          inclined to give permanent work to
          colored men as teamsters, they could
          find plenty of respectable colored men
          right here in Chicago who are fam
          iliar with the city, and they would
          be in a much better position to act
          as teamsters, providing they were as
          sured steady situations, than that
          class of colored men who are thrown
          in here from the rural districts of the
          South who are like a fish out of water
          or a wild horse In a city like Chicago.
          But the managers of the Employers'
          Teaming Company, and the Anns re
          ferred to seemingly only want to
          deal with the roving and the unre
          sponsible Negro, so that they can
          handle them for a short time to suit
          as Italian Field & Co.
          and Handel Brothers.
          MiigCoiicerns
          themselves. It is therefore the duty i
          of the Afro American preachers, re
          siding in this city, to proclaim aloud
          from their pulpits against flooding
          Chicago, at this particular time, with
          so many colored men, who resemble
          or act like desperadoes, and judging
          by the conduct of many of them they
          are ready to cut and shoot at the
          ftrnn of the hat.
          The press in general should In a
          manly way help to discourage this
          .. i, .1 i.
          practice oi rusnmg uiuuuuua ui vm-i
          ored men into this city to act as tools !
          foi the puffed up millionaires who are
          Negro haters at heart and who have)
          no use nor resptvt for colored mu
          except to use them whenever they
          want to browbeat and bulldoze, and
          lord it over their white help.
          Our chief contention is that It adds
          nothing -to the credit of the Negro to
          become professional strikebreakers
          and the presence of this class of Ne
          groes in Chicago at the present time
          makes it much more difficult for the
          respectable colored people in this
          community to get a long, and they as -
          sist to greatly increase all kinds of
          lawlessness which is now flourishing
          in this city.</text>

          I
          New York, May 4. At 1:35 this
          morning Recorder Qoff took his seat
          on tho bench In tho general sessions
          court and ordered that tho Jury which
          had been sifting tho ovldenco In tho
          Nan Patterson case since noon yester
          day, bo brought beforo him. When
          they camo In, In chargo of the deputy
          -aherlffs, they wero told to take their
          places In tho Jury box.
          Recorder doff then called for tho
          defendant. A court officer In answer
          said that tho girl was 111 and In no
          condition to be brought luto court.
          "Who says so?" demanded tho re
          corder In an angry lono of voice.
          "She must be In this court room, and
          I want her here. Send for tho war
          den of tho Tombs at once."
          A few moments later Deputy Jailor
          Koljy, In charge of tho Tombs at night,
          camo Into court and told tho recorder
          that Miss Patterson was 111 In bed and
          that the matron was attending her.
          "You e back to tho prison and bring
          her before me at once." said tho re
          corder. "The interests of Justice de
          mands her presence horo at this time
          and hfero sho must and shall bo pro
          duced." Kelly left Immediately and said sho
          would be brought Into court as soon as
          possible It is cortoin that the Jury
          has not yet agreed, but whether they
          .will bo ldcked up for tho night Is
          problematic.
          At 1:55 tho foreman mado tho an
          nouncement that it was Impossible to
          reach an agreement.
          Recorder Goff ordered tho Jury back
          for further deliberation.
          Nan Patterson had been brought Into
          court and watched tho procedure in a
          frightened manner. She was plainly
          iinnorved and terribly disappointed at
          ho outcome, as sho had been confi
          dent of acquittal.
          Tho recorder questioned Foreman
          lAldrlch If thoro were any poinis oi
          law or on ovldenco that tho Jury de
          Blrod to bo enlightened on.
          Tho foreman" replied that he could
          not say, whereupon Recorder Goff di
          rected Uiut the Jury retire for a short
          confeienco to determine, if possible if
          thoro, wero any points in the ovldnce
          or on tho question of law that tho
          Jury desired tho court to explain.
          All through the procedure, Nan Pat
          terson, tho defendant sat In a chair in
          a half collapsed condition, "lno gin
          had retired some time beforo she was
          summoned and had to be hastily dress
          ed and brought Into court.
          After tho Jury had rptlred, to again
          consult as to whether or not they
          wanted information "Nan" sat in an
          attitude of dejoction beside her coun
          sel, Sho had lost all of her chic air
          and was very norvous.
          f Miss Patterson was dressed in her
          usual black dress. A court offlcer laid
          a bottle of salts In front of her. Her
          breast heaved convulsively and she
          looked crlnglngly at tho Jury.
          Recorder Goff said lu addressing thu
          Jury: "I have recelvod a communica
          tion from you in which you state that
          you have considered all tho evidence
          and discussed it fully and that you aie
          unlikely to reach an agreement. Now,
          gentlemen, you havo been out nearly
          thirteen hours. Shall I. accept this
          communication as final?"
          "I think the Jury will be unable lo
          reach a verdict," BaJd Foreman Aid
          rich. New York, May 3. Tho Jury trying
          Nan Patterson for the murder of hor
          Jovor, Caesar Young, stood, according
          to gourU offlcere who should know,
          Hovon for acquittal and five for con
          viction at 12 o'clock tonight and thero
          was overy indication that no verdict
          .would be reached before tho Jury Is
          locked up for the night. After 11
          hours of deliberation the Jurors aro
          said to be as wide apart as on tho first
          ballot and predictions' aro freely mado
          thut tho Jury will report a disagree
          ment as in tho second trial, when six
          jurors stood for conviction and six
          lor ucqulttol. Tho actress waited for
          llio verdict In tho sheriff's office- on tho
          floor below the court room up to mid
          night. The deliberations in the Jury room
          wore earnest and it was soon evident
          thai; tho Jurors wero wldo apart in
          their onlnlons. Tho Questions or
          whether J. Morgan Smith bought tho
          revolver and If tho bookmaker shot
          himself wero thrashed out tlmo and
          again. One of tho early ballots show
          ed that seven stood for acquittal, four
          for conviction And ono Juror voting a
          blank. The question of degreo of
          murdor was touched on and several of
          those standing for conviction declared
          themselves for manslaughter in tho
          first degreo. In order to make a more
          careful analysis of tho disputed points
          It was docided to sond for Young's
          coat and vest and tho rovolver. Later
          Uio skeleton and charts of tho scene
          of tho shooting and tho cab were sent
          for. Soveral Jurors experimented with
          the revolver to ascrtaln If It would be
          possible to Inflict a wound as Indicated
          on tho skeleton. Ono of the Jurors
          simulated Young and put on the dead
          man's coat.
          Every step tho defendant and tho
          bookmaker took 24 hours before the
          shooting was gono oyer and the long
          and serious arguments mado over ov
          ery questioned point.
          Shortly after Recorder Goff, who had
          remained In chambers all the aftor
          noon sent word to the Jurors that ho
          was going homo but could bo reached
          quickly at any tlmo up to a late hour.
          Hunger made a strong plea about this
          tlmo and It was decided to tako a re
          cess until 10 o'clock. Tho jury was
          escorted by a cordon of 20 police out
          of tho Franklin street entrance to the
          sidewalk, where the jurors lined up
          throo abreast. Thoy wero thon flank
          ed on all sides by a score of patrol
          men to project them from the mob
          which stormed the entrance of the
          building and flllod the street. Down
          Center street the Jurors wero marched
          to a restaurant downtown while a
          crowd of over 300 trailed along In ho
          roar. A force of ..police was required
          to disperse tho crowd in front of the
          restauraut, When the Jury returned
          at 10 o'clock thb discussion of the
          disputed questions was continued. A
          ballot was taken and from trustworthy
          sources It was learned that It stood
          soven for acquittal and Ave for con
          viction. This was all at 11 o'clock and
          hope of somo agreement tonight was
          abandoned.
          When It became tlmo to extinguish
          tho lights In tho Tombs prison, Nnn
          Patterson was brought over to th
          court building by Shorlff Flynu to his
          office beneath tho court room, where
          she awaited the verdict. Sho had re
          covered somo of hor early composure
          and talked cheerfully to her father,
          who felt tho hope of acquittal slipping
          from hinuovery momont that passed.
          Tho old man later camo Into the court
          room and sat down and quietly await
          ed. Ho sat apart from tho others,
          alono with his hopes and his fears.
          "I hope for the best," ho said. "I
          hopo for the beat. They won't con
          vlco my girl. I know, I feel thoy
          won't."
          Tho ojd man broke down and cried
          and no words seemed to cheer him.
          Thoro seemed to bo more compassion
          for the fatljer than for the daughter.
          New York, May J3. -A night of rest
          lessness because of the prosecutor's
          scathing arraignment was followed by
          a day of doubt and anxiety for the
          Florodora girl becau3o of tho uncer
          tainty of tho Jury's deliberations. Her
          sister, Julia Smith, spoke parting
          words of cheer and hope as tho actress
          was led away to Recorder Goff's court
          but tho high contract of tho touches
          of artificial red In the pallid cheeks
          told the throng In tho court room of
          tho fear in hor heart. Sho scarcely
          looked at the jurors as they sat In tue
          box listening to Recorder Goff's
          charge; sho feared to look at thorn at
          all as thoy filed out into tho Jury room
          to mako their truo deliverance. When
          tho recorder had concluded his charge
          sho was led back half-reeling to tho
          prisoner's pen, where sho throw herself
          In her. old father's arras and cried un
          restrainedly. Tho girl, who sat dull

          Mrs. Dielhenn, Prominent Massillon Woman, Seri
          ously Hurt Collision Occurred Near
          Canton Last Night.
          In a collision betwoen a Canton
          Akron Interurban car and an automo
          bile near the Raff road west ot Can
          ton last night, shortly before 9
          o'clock, Mrs. H. C. Dielhenn of Mas
          sillon was seriously Injured, tho doc
          tors being" of tho opinion that she has
          sustained a fracture of the skull near
          tho base of tho brain. Tho automo
          bile was occupied by Mr. Dielhenn,
          his wife, a son and two daughters.
          While tho auto was wrecked none of
          the other occupants woro Injured to
          any extent.
          "The machlno was being operated by
          Mr. Harry Dielhenn, tho son, and Just
          before tho car was mot ho turned out
          to pass a horse and buggy. Tho car
          camo on at a good rate of speed and
          the nuto was between the buggy and
          tho track. Tho young man thought ho
          had cleared the car, but was so blinded
          by the headlight that ho could not see
          anything. When he saw that a col
          lision was Inevitable he Jumped. The
          car struck the automobile and whirled
          It around with great force and turn
          ings over on its edge.
          Tho street car was stopped within
          two lengths of itself and tho passeng
          ers and train men hurried to the scene,
          Mrs. Dielhenn was found unconscious
          lying alongside of the wrecked auto
          mobile. Sho was taken on the car
          and brought to tho car barns, whole
          Mlllor & Blanchard's ambulance was
          called and she was removed to the
          office of Dr. E. O. Morrow. Sho re
          gained consciousness but was vomit
          ing blood and there was hemorrhage
          from the right ear. These symptoms
          Indicate that thero Is a fracture of tho
          skull near the base of tho brain and It
          may prove fatal. After the examina
          tion Mrs. Dielhenn was removed to the
          Aultmau hospital, where sho seemed
          to brighten. Her greatest concern
          after recovering consciousness was for
          the safety of tho others and sho was
          not satisfied until all bad come to her
          bedside and assured her that thoy were
          not hurt. The escape of tho othor
          members of tho family was almost
          miraculous.
          Mr. Dielhenn is a prominent and
          wealthy business man of Massillon and
          when tho news reached that city of
          tlio accident there was a groat deal of
          excitement. Mr. and Mrs. John DIcI
          grenn and Ed Albright, a rolntlve,
          came to the hospital In another au

          at 8:30 and was duo hero at 9. Pas
          sengers on the car stated that It was
          running at a good rato of speed, but
          that there wa3 not much Jar from the
          collision or from the sudden stopping
          of tho car.</text>

          (By Associated' Press.-)
          Chicago, III., July 21. The teamster

          thousand men who quit not more than
          fourteen hundrod or fifteen hundred
          will be reinstated within the next few
          days. Tho coal teamsters and truck
          drivers did not Join in tho rush tor re
          employment. They balked at tho ordor
          nnd planned to hold meetings tonight
          and "fight it out till they oan go back
          to work Uko union men."
          Chicago, III., July 21. Tho team
          sters' striko Hint has so greatly dis
          turbed bualnosa oondltions In this olty
          for tho last ono hundred and Ave days,
          was at 12:30 o'clock last night official
          ly declared oft by the mombers of tho
          teamsters' Joint council. Tho mon
          havo beon crdorod to seek ihPir old
          positions .and It is astlmatod that less
          than one-half of thorn will bo .ro-om-ployed.
          Tho strikers have mado a
          complete surrender and will apply for
          work as Individuals and without an
          agreement of any kind with their em
          ployers. Tho action of tho teamsters'
          joint council was taken at the ond of
          the dey whose events clearly foreshad
          owed the collapse of the strike. Throo
          of tho unions had already voted-to re
          turn to work as far as possible and It
          was certain that the unions which had
          not yet voted on the question of end
          ing the strike would take similar ac
          tion. The council believing that fur
          ther effort was useless, decided to call
          oft the strike nt once.
          'Hie first break la Uie ranks of the
          strikers came yesterday afternoon,
          when the lumber teamsters voted to
          return to work regardless of what ac
          tion might be taken by any other un
          ion. Last night the department store
          drivers ami the railwa yexpress drivers
          voted to oall ott the strike and seek
          their old positions in the morulas;. It
          Is expected that about sixty per cent
          of the dejwrtment store drivers wilt be
          reinstated, and the express drivers de
          clared thet they believed that about
          one hundred of their number would be
          taken back by the express companies.
          The oxpreee oompaaies have declared
          all through the strike, however, that
          not one of the men wlto struck would
          ever he reinstated.
          The only ooHoeeskwi that the men
          havo gained by going back to work Is
          in the oe se of the lumber drivers, the
          right to wear the union button. In the
          ouse of all other unions the men by
          seeking their old places tacitly agree
          to the terras of the employers, which
          wero that only such men would be tak
          en back as were needed after the non
          union men had been profidod for. and
          that the question or wearing the union lroember Mr Olds gives s his jea
          buttons should be left to the decision wn that there Is too much wrangling
          of the Individual employer. n the board. The members, it Is said.</text>

        <text>TEAMSTERS GET $1.50 RAISE
          There will be no teamsters' strike.
          The employers have come completely
          to time. The teamsters will get the
          $1.50 a week advance they asked.
          At first the employers, said they
          would not raise 'wages' a cent, then
          . they. offered 50 cents a week raise,
          then 75 cents, then $1, and when
          Jhese offers wererejected it became
          certain the. teamsters would strike if
          they did not get the $1.50 raise they
          asked, the employers gave in.
          The agreement just signed gives a
          minimum of $15 and a maximum of
          $23 a week. It is effective for 5 years.

        <text>TEAMSTERS' STRIKE IS
          PRACTICALLY CERTAIN
          To Come Saturday Unless Trou
          ble .of Freight Handlers
          ... Is Settled.
          A strike of union teamsters in
          Chicago, in sympathy with strik
          ing freight handlers, is a certainty
          unless the differences between the
          freight handlers and the railroads
          are settled before the end of the
          week.
          This was definitely decided
          upon yesterday at a conference
          between officers of the freight
          handlers and teamsters, and at a
          mass meeting of the teamsters
          last night the-attitude of their of
          ficers was approved. Power to
          call a strike now lies in the hands
          of vthe teamsters' officials.
          This action, which will par
          alyze the moving of freight from
          local warehouses, has been-decid-ed
          upon only after every effort
          has been made by the -freight
          .handlers to settle the strike
          through arbitration.
          Thinking that the trouble
          would be adjusted, the teamsters
          have o fsar averted an open
          breach. Now, however, fhey are
          determined to strike,. refusing to
          handle good trucks by non-union
          freight handlers. --
          A definite time for the suspen
          sion of work has not yet beende
          cided upon, but it was said at the
          offices of the freight handlers'
          union this afternoon that the men
          would be out by Saturday unless
          the railroads came to time.
          There is little likelihood of a
          settlement. On two previous oc
          casions President Garnett of the
          General Managers' association,
          declared there was nothing to ar
          bitrate, as the roads were not feel-'
          ing -the effect of the strike, and ,
          would refuse to treat with an or-,
          ganization that had gone on
          strike.

        <text>'Not Break Out in the Teamsters' Strike. ' '
          When I joined tfie group at the
          rear table in Stumpy, Dan's place,
          Douglas ' Belford 'was- "holding
          forth violently' on the subject of
          sluggers.
          "They should hang them on
          high from' lamp posts," he said.
          "I judge" no man who takes the
          life of another in fair fight,, but
          he who does so frpm behind, and
          formoney is a dog, and should die
          the death of a dog."
          "You are right," said'Wqoden
          legged Donohue. "A slugger is
          no better than a wild, beast."
          A short, stockily bujlt man,
          who-sat in'the far corner, smote
          the palm of his hand upon the ta
          ble so that all the glasses jin
          gled. .
          "You fellow? don't knowjwhat
          you're talking?ab'outj" he said. k'
          "Would ypii defend a man who
          murders another from behind?"
          cried Belford, hotly.
          'T defend no one," said the
          man, "nor do I judge any man.:
          But I will tell you a story, which
          is a true story, and you can make
          what you please'of it iM
          "This happened years ago,
          when I was in the-secret service,
          and at a time when all the team
          sters in the Big City were- on
          strike. '
          "I had been moved from' the
          West by Washington not ' long
          before.' 'Twas meant by way 'of
          promotion, but it sickened me of
          the service. I found'that men in
          the employ of the government
          we're used 'by great corporations,
          aiid that but no matter, these
          things have nothing to do with
          the story.
          "I was alone in the office one
          day when I received a. wire from
          Washington. It read:'
          " 'Hear trouble threatened
          teamsters' strike- Prevent it.'
          "I stood up and cursed. Did
          they think that all that was need
          ed to prevent the trouble that
          was brewing then was for a secret
          service man to raise his finger?
          "But I changed into an old s'liit
          of clothes that pight, and went to
          Lou Benger's saloon, which was
          near the teamsters' headquarters,
          and where I might hear' some
          thing. "I had no plan laid out, so I
          went into a little partitioned pff
          compartment in the rear o the sa
          loon, and ordered beer, and sat
          down to think.
          , "And presently two men mov
          ed into the net compartment
          and I could hear their voices.
          They talked of trivial things at
          first, and then this conversation
          took place:
          " 'J have come here to. meet a
          guy that makes me sick. He
          thinks I LIKE to slug men

          $1.10 a week increase brought for
          ward by the Chicago Contracting

          services of the board. Ed Coleman
          of the strikers signified their willing
          ness to arbitrate.
          The main reason for the strike was
          given is that the Contracting Team
          Owners' ass'n raised ;their rates $6
          per week. Workers figured they
          were entitled to $2 of the six.</text>

        <text>SAY TEAMSTERS' STRIKE
          MAY.NOT BE NEEDED
          A strike of the Teamsters'
          union in sympathy wtih. the
          Freight 'Handlers now on strike
          will not be called at present.
          The Teamsters last week Voted
          almost unanimously to strike in
          sympathy, the moment their offi
          cers gave them the word.
          But the freight handlers al
          ready have the railroads so badly
          tied up that it is not thought a
          strike of the teamsters will be
          necessary to bring the railroads
          to time.
          President P. J. Flannery, of the
          Freight Handlers, grinned when
          asked about the situation' today.
          "What is the use of calling the
          teamsters out just now?" he
          asked.
          "The railroad yards are chuck
          full of freight they cannot de
          liver to customers ; freight on the
          road, is'lost; shippers daily are
          complaining to the managers,
          about the non-delivery of prom
          ised goods.
          "Why, the teaming companies
          have even laid off half of their
          barn teams simply because they
          cannot get the freight to put them
          to work. There' islost freight
          scattered along the roads from
          here to the Atlantic coast and
          back- again."
          t Just how much the railroads
          are feeling the tie-up was reveal
          ed -in an almost pitiful plea sent
          to the girl clerks of the Wood
          street freight station of the
          Northwestern by the Northwest
          ern agent.
          jTt was a petition that the girls
          return ta work, arid through three
          long pages it sobbed to them
          about how hurt the railroads felt
          about their cqnduct, and how
          willinghe railroads were to for
          give them if tljey only, would
          come baek. -</text>

        <text>them out if they were arrested. One
          of the cutters, named Desmond,
          working in his shop, was arrested for
          carrying a concealed weapon and
          upon a trial in the Desplaines street
          court on the 20th of October, 1915,
          was discharged.
          "All of the guards working under
          me at five plants of these tailoring
          companies carried either guns or
          black jacks. Out of the nineteen men
          'P who were under me at one time at
          these plants, all of whom were carry
          ing concealed weapons, only tiie fol
          lowing had-been sworn in as special
          police officers: Frank Puller, Ben
          Harris, William Cody, James Mitchell
          and the affiant.
          "Policemen on duty at Lamm &
          Co. receive a stipulated sum of money
          from the cashier at that plant each
          day at noon as follows: Mounted
          sergeant, $5; motorcyclemen, $2; pa
          trolmen, $1. Besides this the same
          detail of motorcyclemen receive $1
          each a day from the Great Western
          Tailoring Co., $1 each a day from the
          Monarch Tailoring Co. Serg't Kil
          Iacky signs the receipts for himself,
          and all of the patrolmen. The cash
          ier receives the receipts from him as
          well as all the other officers who get
          the money.
          "Two city detectives, one named
          Sloier, and another one whose name
          is unknown to me, had been detailed
          by the detective department to report
          each day at the offices of Martin
          Isaacs, chief counsel for the Whole
          sale Tailors Manufacturers' ass'n.
          The first ten days of the" strike they
          used to work on foot, but Isaacs told
          them he would give them an automo
          bile, and Sloier, having the 1912 Ma
          rion car, agreed to allow the Whole-
          sale Clothiers' ass'n the use of it for
          Mi a compensation of $25 a day. Be
          sides this, Sloier and his partner also
          received expense money from Martin
          Isaac's office. In their machine at
          all times during the day will be found
          William Turner, head of the Turner
          Detective Agency, which is supplying
          many of the guards and sluggers for
          the clothing houses affected by the
          strike. Turner gets his instructions
          from Isaacs and then tells Sloier what
          he wants to have done.
          "Detective Sloier operates his car
          himself. Detective Sloier carries
          union cards and wears union buttons.
          I can remember in particular his but
          ton of the truck drivers' union for
          the month of October, 1915. He had
          held a conversation with me regard
          ing the probability of the teamsters
          strike, and he told me and other of
          my guards that he had just been talk
          ing to Mike Galvin, one of the heads
          of the teamsters' organization, and
          Galvin had told him for a fact that
          'there would be no teamsters' strike.
          Sloier claimed to have all the inside
          dope on the various unions, and has
          full access to the Hod Carriers' hall.
          "Affiant says that before being em
          ployed by the Harding Detective
          Agency his reputation as a slugger
          was known to the said P. J. Harding,
          and that while employed at the plant
          of Lamm & Co., one of their sales
          men, Neeley, by name, a resident of
          , Terre Haute, Ind., recognized this
          affiant and said to him: 'Aren't you
          the fellow who was going to blow up
          the judge's house down in Terre
          'Haute?' And that said Neeley did
          take affiant to A. H. Lamm and tell
          him what he knew about my past
          I record, further informing him that he
          1 could depend upon affiant to do any
          thing that might be ordered in the
          line of strong-arm work.
          "Affiant further says that the ma
          jority of the guards on the operation
          for the tailoring houses have bad po
          lice records."

        <text>STRIKE END IN SIGHT
          Des Moines, la., Oc 7. The
          end of the teamsters' strike, called
          one week ago, is believed to be in
          sight -f
          Sunday afternoon, 8,000 union
          men marched through the streets
          at a funeral pace to protest
          against the unfair combination 6f
          Trig business, city and county of
          ficials against the strikers.
          Big business spread reports far
          and wide that the parade would
          mean bloodshed, and asked for
          the jnilitia.
          The quiet orderliness of the
          parade, in which there were 300
          women, after this canard, has
          greatly impressed the people with
          the justice of the strikers' cause.</text>

          night. The fire originated on the stage
          nt nalt-past eleven o clock when the com
          pany was about half through the last act
          ot the Two Orphans.
          The fire spread with lightning rapidity
          and burst out through the door on Wash
          ington street. The panic and eonfasicm
          among the aodienca was terrible. A
          number of persons must be badly injured
          and some probably killed.

          The theater was owned by Kingsley
          Keeney aad others, and was rented to
          Shook 4; Palmer, of tbB Ucion Square
          theater, New York. The loss on the
          theater is about $250,000. At 1 o'clock
          the Cre was still bumins, but under per
          fect control. The ore was caused by the
          gas setting fire to the woodwork in one ot
          tb wings.
          The lire originated in the flies, which,
          while bLzing, foil on top of the scenery.
          One of the actresses came to the front of
          the btage, and said: "A small accident
          hai occurred, but don't be alarmed; only
          a piece of fly is on fire." At the men

          fjet and male a rush for the doors. The
          smote soon became suffocating, and

          were trim pled over. Numbers jumped
          out of the windows and were severely
          injured. Three were picked up and sent
          to the Long Island College Hospital, and
          are not expected to live.
          A youog man who jumped out cf the

          dock, one of the leading actors in the
          Brooklyn Theater Company, is missing,
          aud is thought to have perished by the
          burniug of the theater last night. Sev
          eral residents of Brooklyn who are sup
          posed to have attended the performance
          last niuht have not returned to their
          homes, and it is feared that an examina
          tion of the ruins to-day will result in
          finding the charred remains of these
          missir.( persons.
          LATER.
          The fire in Brooklyn theater last nicbt
          wis attended by appalling loss ot life.
          I', is thought that not less than 100 per
          sons were killed in the msh to the exit
          or burned lo death, being unable to es
          cape. The fire broke out during the per
          formance of the last scene of the Two
          Orphass, in which Mies Claxton was
          playing ihe heroine. Ia five minntes
          mote the audience would have been dis-
          missd, and there would have been noth
          ing more sejious to record than the de
          struction of property.
          The bouse was about two thirds filled.
          those bfliw sitting well forward toward
          the stage. For those in the family cir
          cle, dres3 circle and galleries, there was
          no possible way of escape except by
          Washington street. The panic-stricken
          people rushel pell mell toward and down
          the tUirways. The main exit became
          immediately choked up and a scene of
          terror, confusion and distress ensued
          which begcars description. Just' above
          thi landine nlace nf th .,:
          woman in the crush had her font rn.t,.
          between the banisters and fell. The

          ItGed peODlo Still fllrth,., kt,:.i t
          over her and piled on top of each other
          four ar.d five deep.
          The polics from the station house, nex t
          door, were promptly at the scene, but
          owing to the manner in which the peo
          ple were piled up on top of each other
          and massed together, they could extri
          oate comparatively few, and these were
          all bruised, bleeding and maimed.
          The firemen got to work on the ruin
          shortly .Iter delight this morning
          They succeaded in getting as far as le
          fall of the dress circle, where they found
          great number of bodies, and immedi
          ately began the work of removal, aud up
          tiil 11 o'clock sixty-five bodies had been
          recovered, and what appeared to be
          twenty or thirty more were seen ia the
          bisomeot, into which they had been pre
          eipitatcd by tho falling of the burning
          uoors.
          Adjoining the burned tbeator the
          names of eighty-six persons ml.n.
          from their homes h
          Kate Claxton, at the preliminary ex
          amination of the fire mhnhal, said; "At
          the begioning of the last act, just as tha
          cartam want up, I ,erd a rumbling
          noise on Ihe stage, and two minutes ifu.
          I saw the flamej and fire; the; teemed t I
          be all on thestaze. Mrs. Farren, myself,
          Mr. Studlry aad Mr. Murdoch were on
          the stage at this time. We four remained
          there and endeavored as best we could
          to quiet the audience and prevent a
          panic. I said to the people: 'Be quiet.
          We ere between you and the fire. The
          front door is open and the passages are
          clear.' Not one cf the audiecce jurcped
          on the stag?. The flames were then com
          ing down on us. I ran out and jumped
          over several people. Mr. II. S Mur
          doch, after endeavoring to calm the fears '
          of the panie stricken psople, went to his
          dressing room to get bis clothing and
          must have bcea suffocated."
          Erooklys, December 6, 12 m. The
          number of bodies thas far recovered from
          the ruins is about seventy-five, and it is
          believed that as many more are still in
          the ruins. They are mostly those of the
          occupants of the family circle.
          The Brooklyn Eagle famishes the fol
          lowing in advance of publication: "The
          work ol identifying the dead will be diffi
          cult for most of them are burned beyond
          recognition. The only mode of identify
          ing will be by personal property found
          attached to the bodies. Thus far it is
          only evideat that tbeflunes made com
          mon havoc with men, women and chil
          dren."
          Shortly bafore 9 o'clock llev. Father
          Hanley visited the theater and amone
          tne bodies recognized the brother of
          Rv. Father Kylie. Father Kylie was
          present and recognized the body of his
          brother. The body was taken from ihs
          rains charred and blackened almost be
          yond recognition. In the breast pocket
          of his coat were a number cf cards hear
          ing the name "Abraham Barnett
          in
          German text.
          The bodies are constantly being re
          moved from the ruins and ari taken to
          the morgue as fast as possible.
          It is rumored that a nnmbar of at
          taches of the theater are burned.- It
          seems certain that Charles Lott and his
          son, who were stationed in the upper
          gallery, are among the lost.
          The actors aod actresses esciped from
          the stage iu'o Johnson street.
          J. W. Thorp, the stage manager, savs
          the fire occurred, in this wise: A drop
          was ignited from a border licht by
          some means inexplicable, as one was
          guarded from ihe other. He immedi
          ately directod stage carpenter Weaver
          and two supernumeraries to endeavor to
          extinguish the flme, bht the difficulty
          wis to reach the part on fire. The stage
          carpenter, with the supernumeraries,
          essayed to effect the object by lowering
          a drop and in so doing added fuel to the
          fl iraes. The scene, the last in the play,
          embraced a ceiled apartment, and the
          instant the burning drop came in ou
          tlet with the inflammable ceiling reivrd
          Uepreidthe existing flames in a flash
          as thoueb powder hai previously been
          scattered about. The scenery and the
          entire properties were iu a blazi. The
          usual avenues of escape were thus sum
          marily closed at the rear, and an exit, if
          at all possible, had to be raide by way
          ef the box entrance. All, except Der-
          Lhapjotie or two, thus escaped. It is
          now believed that ths number of dead
          will be about one hundred and tweotv-
          fiTB.
          The courts adjoumel this morning
          without transacting any business. There
          is intense excitement in the city, and
          business is partially suspended. The
          Pe.rk Theater has besn closed for the
          week. A meeting of the theatrical pro
          fessioo has been called for Thursday to
          concert measures for relief. Hon. Henry
          C. Murphy, a distinguished citizen of
          Brooklyn and well-known throughout the
          country, is among the missing.
          Wagon-loads of rouyh boxes are ar
          riving iu front of the theater and corpses
          are placed in them and covered with
          tarpaulin and carried to the morgue.
          The tcece grows more terrible every
          minute. Men and women are crowding
          the station-house and theater entrance
          making inquiry fjr missing friends. Iu
          some instaucos whuls families have
          perished. The bodies present every
          form of contortion, just as they stiffened
          in the last agony, when the floor gave
          way and they plunged down in the blind
          ing smoke and flames; arms and legs are
          bent and twisted ia every way, hands are
          clenched aud reach out as if grasping
          for help.
          The Post says that about 11 o'clock a
          horrible discovery was made. In the
          middle of what was the lobby of the
          thet'er lay an immense pile of rubbish,
          smoldering beams, fragments of gridtrs
          and other things. This heap was nearly
          opposite the principal entrance to the
          audjlory of the theater. Beyond it was
          another heap, marking the place where
          the stairs which led to the gallery fell
          uuuer me neap brtt mentioned a
          dead body was found; and the
          Grtrnen diligently prosecuted their
          search in this direction. With much
          labor some of the heaviest lumber was
          removed and a horrible Bight was re
          veiiled beneath. Corpses lay in rows
          heaped one upon the other packed to
          gether with fearful solidity, which told
          of the great pressure to which they hnd
          bsen subjected. How many lay there,
          what their sex or age, no man could tell,
          and at noon only guesses conld be made.
          Another actor, Claude Burroughs, is
          now reported missing.
          Thus far but three corpses have been
          identified-thoie of .Hugh Dover and
          Nicholas Keilcy, 117 Library street, and
          John Woods, 11 Fleet Plaoe.
          The Brooklyn Argus states that up to
          one o'clock ninety-four bodies had been
          taken from the ruins and others were

          in searoh of the charred remains of the
          poor people who lost their lives in the
          vain efttrt to escape from the smoke and
          fiames which surrounded them.
          The scene during the lire was a terri
          ble one. It was a desperate rush and
          struggle for life, and bodies of girls,
          women and children, and mituy ol the
          men unable to rem the doora
          are now being removed from
          the ruins, while friends and relatives
          ot missing persons are crowded in tbe
          Station-house, tearfully examining hats.

          Miss Kate Claxton and Mrs. Farren

          names of eighty-six missing per$ons have
          neon reported at the Btation.house, and
          it is believed in some instances whole
          families have perished. Four muter
          takers' wagons have been busily ea
          tilk:a all the morning hauling away the
          dead. The full horror of the sickening
          scene will not be fully developed until
          later la the day. --

          canto general before the actors left the
          stage. A wild rugh was made for the
          door.
          Women shrieked, struggled and faint
          ed, men plunged in mad terror over
          seats and fought their way to the door
          like wild be tots. The aisles were
          blocked, and as the fire danced and
          hissed through the combustible ma- ,
          chinery and darted out over the beads
          of the orchestra the demoralization be-'
          came complete.
          In two minutes the stage was one
          mass of &Imes. The heat was so in-,
          tense that many who occupied the seats
          nearest the stage sank helpless to the
          floor, an-d were dragged out la an in
          sensible eondition.
          Mrs. Farren alludes to the panic as
          something horrible to witness and im
          possible to desoribe. It is believed none
          of the employes lost, their lives.
          If every bit of the scenery had been
          drenChed in kerosene the fire could not
          have spread more rapidly nor furiously.
          Even betore any fire engine had re
          sponded the auditorium was a sea of
          lire.
          The flames burst through the roof, and
          gathering tore by this suet up into tile
          air, (tarrying pieces of' the scenerv to a
          dIstance of half a mile. In ten minutes
          the fire had spread to every part of the
          theater.

          midnight the fire Wag at Its height,
          and the great auditorium was a
          volcano of fire, the root had been scat
          tered to the winds in cinders, and the
          times, in a bright, mighty mass dancing
          high in the air, preeented a terrible
          spectacle.
          Up to noon, eighty-seven dead bodies
          had been recovered from the ruins. The
          supposttiou now is that two hundred
          persons wore killed.
          Up to 8:30 o'clock this afternoon one

          been taken from the ruins, and it is esti

        <text>Nnw York, December 6. The fire in the
          Brooklyn theater last night was attended, by
          the mostappallinglossof life, and it is thought
          that not less than one hundred persons wtre

          death, being unable to escape. The fire broke
          out during the performance of the last scene
          of the Two Orphans, in which Miss Clax
          tonplay the heroine. In fivo minutes
          more the audience would have been
          dismissed, and there would have been: noth
          ing more serious to record than the destruc
          tion of the property. The house was about
          two-thirds filled. Those below, sitting: well
          forward toward the stage, and for those in
          the family-circle, dress-circle and galleries,
          there was
          XO WAY OF liSC.U'E,
          except by Washington street. The panic
          stricken people rushed pell-mell toward and
          down the stairways. The main exit became
          immediately choked up. and a scene of terror.
          confusion and distress ensued which beggars
          description, just above the landing place oi
          Uie stairway, a woman in the crush had her
          foot pushed between the banisters and fell.
          The crowd behind, forced forward by the ter
          med people still iurther behind, fell over her
          and piled on top of each oUier four and five
          deep. The police from Uie stationhouse next
          door were promptly at the scene, but owing
          to the manner in which the people were piled
          up on top of each other and massed together
          they could extricate comparatively few, and
          these were all
          BRUISED, 11LEEDIXG AND MAIMED.
          The firemen crot to work on the ruins short
          ly after daylight this morning. They suc
          ceeded in getting as far as the fall of the
          dress-circle, where they found a great num
          ber of bodies, and immediately began the
          work of removal. Up to eleven o'clock sixty
          five bodies had been recovered, and what ap
          peared to be twenty or thirty more were seen
          in Uie basement, into which they had been
          precipitated by the falling of Uie burning
          uoors. At the police station, adioinim? the
          burned theater, the names of eighty-six per
          sons missing from Uieir homes have been reg
          istered. Kate Claxton, at Uie preliminary in
          quiry of the fire-marshal, said: "At the be
          ginning of the last act, just as the curtain
          went up, I heard a rupbling noise on Uie
          stage, and two minutes afterward I saw the
          flames. The fire seemed to be all on the
          stage. Mrs. Farren, myself, Mr. Studley and
          Mr. Murdoch were on the stage at Uiis time.
          We four remained there and endeavored, as
          best we could, to quiet the audience and
          ritEVEKT A l'AXICV
          "1 said to Uie people: 'Beauiet. we arc be
          tween you and the fire; the front door is
          open and the passages are clear. Not one of
          trie audience jumped on Uie stage. The
          flames were Uien coming down on us, and J
          ran and jumped over several people. Mr. H.
          S. Murdoch, after endeavoring to calm the
          fears of the panic-stricken people, went to
          his dressing-room to get Ins clothing and
          must have been suffocated."
          The Brooklyn Eaqle furnishes the follow
          ing in advance of publication:
          THE WORK OF IDENTIFYING THE DEAD
          will be difficult, for most of them are burned
          beyond recognition. The only mode of iden-
          tiiying vm. be by the personal property loimd
          attached to bodies. Thus far it is only evi
          dent that the flames made common havoc
          with men, women and children. ShorUy be
          fore nine o'clock, Rev. Father Hanley visited
          the theater, and among the bodies recognized
          that of the brother of Rev. Father Kylie.
          Father Kylie was present and identified Uie
          body of his broUier, and Uie body was taken
          lrom the rums, charred and blackened beyond
          recognition. In Uie breast-pocket of Uie coat
          were a num-oer of cards bearing the name of
          Abraham Harnett, m Oerman text. Ihe
          bodies are constantly being removed from the
          ruins and are taken to the morgue as fast as
          possible. 1 1 is. rumored that a number of at
          taches of the theater are burned. It seems
          certain that Charles Lott and his son, who
          were stationed in the upper gallery, are
          anioncr the lost. The actors and actresses es
          caped from Uie stage into Johnson street.
          ORIGIN OF TIIE FIRE.
          Mr. J. W. Thorp, stage manager, states
          that Uie fire occurred in this wise: A drop
          was ignited from a bonier light by some
          means inexplicable, as one was guarded from
          the other. He immediately directed Stage
          Carpenter Weaver and two supernumeraries
          to endeavor to extinguish the name, but the
          difficulty was to reach Uie port on fire. The
          stage carpenter, with the supernumeraries,
          essayed to effect the object by lowering Uie
          drop, and in so doing added fuel to the
          flames. The scene, the last in play, em
          braced a ceiled apartment, and the instant
          the burning drop came in contact -with the
          inflammable ceiling served to spread the exist
          ing flames in a flash, as though powder had
          previously been scattered about the scenery.
          The entire properties were in a blaze. The
          usuid avenues of escape were thus summari
          ly closed at the rear, and an exit, it possible,
          had to be madciby way of the box entrance.
          All, except perhaps one or two, thus escaped.
          It is now believed that the number of (lead
          will be about
          . ONE UUXnUEU AND TWENTY-FIVE.
          The Brookhyn courts adjourned this
          morning without transacting any busi
          ness, fhcre is intense excitement in the
          citv and business is partially suspended.
          The Park theater has been closed for the
          week. A meeting of the theatrical profes
          sion has been called for Thurs lay, to concert
          measures of p-elief. Hon. Henry. C. Mur
          phv, a distinguished citizen of Brooklyn and
          well known throughout the country, is among
          the missing.
          Wagon loads of rough boxes arc arriving
          in front of Uie theater and the corpses are
          placed in them and covered with tarpaulin
          and carried to the morgue. The scene grows
          more terrible every minute. Men and women
          are crowding around the stationhouse and
          theater entrance making inquiries for missing
          friends. In some instances
          WHOLE FAMILIES HAVE PERISHED.
          The bodies present every form of contortion,
          just as they stiffened m Uie last agony when
          the floor gave way and they plunged down in
          Uie blinding smoke and flames. Arms and
          legs are bended and twisted in every way;
          hands' are clenched, and reach out as if grasp
          ing Jor help, the I'ost says at about eleven
          o'clock a horrible discovery vas made. In
          the middle of what was the lobby of Uie Uiea
          ter lay an immense pile of rubbish, smoulder
          ing beams, fragments of girdera, and other
          things. This heap was nearly opposite the
          principal entrance to Uie auditory of the thea
          ter; beyond it was' another heap, marking
          the place where the stjairs which- led to tlje
          gallery full underi In the heap first men
          tioned a dead body was found, and the fire
          men diligently prosecuted their search in this
          direction with much labor. Somo of the
          heaviest lumber was removed, and a
          H0URI11LE SIGHT
          was revealed beneath that mound. The
          corpses lay in rows, heaped one upon another
          and packed with fearful solidity, which told
          of Uie great pressure to which they had been
          pnbwted. How many lav there which could
          could bo distinguished by their sex or age, no
          man could .tell, and at noon only guesses
          could be made. Another actor, Claude Bur
          roughs, is now reported missing. Thus far
          but three corpses have been identified these
          of Hugh J. Dover and Nicholas Keiley. M'Kil
          lary street, and John Woods, 11 Fleet place.
          At two o'clock one hundred and fifteen
          bodies had been recovered, and there are
          probably as many more within" Uie ruins.
          Some persons assert that no one in the upjwr
          gahVry of the theater escaped. The last man
          that left the stairs before they fell, savs that
          behind hmij was the helpless" half-suffocated
          crowd.
          Orr Washington street a line of horses and
          wagons arc waiting to remove the bodies.
          Great crowds of persons arc gathered in the,
          neighborhood of the morgue to identify miss
          ing relatives and friends, and their lamenta
          tions are truly pitiful. It requires a force of
          the police to keep them from crowding over
          each other. The actors themselves had great
          difficulty in effecting their escape. Going
          back of the stage, their advance was cut off
          by the flames that played around the usual
          placo of egress and struggled from beyond
          to burst open the door. Miss Claxton, an
          other lady, Mr. Mathews and another gentle
          man succeeded in entering the dark under
          ground passage-way to the box office, and
          saved themselves with' difficulty. Stuart
          Campbell, short-hand reporter on the Com
          mercial Advertiser, is among the victims;
          also police officer Patrick Keon.
          2:40' p.m. Up to this hour one hundred
          and'tmrty bodies have been removed, and
          others are still in the ruins.
          4 p.m. One hundred and seventy-five
          bodies havo been taken from the ruins of the
          Uieater. The ruins are still burning, making
          the work of removing the bodies very diffi
          cult. Flags are at half-mast throughout the
          city, and the theaters are draped in mourn
          ing. Horror upon horror accumulated as tho day
          advanced Corpse after corpse, charred and
          blackened, was passed out, and still the pile
          of bodies in the cellar did not seem to dimin
          ish. As the number mounted up to one hun
          dred and one and one hundred and sixty, the
          belief Uiat the number would reach over two
          hundred grew into a certainty, and finally at
          half-past four o'clock the two hundredth lxdy
          was removed. Some were found with their
          limbs and hands burned off, and nothing left
          but a ghastly, blackened trunk. At five
          o'clock the number had reached two hundred
          and twenty bodies taken out in half an hour.
          A look into the pit at this time showed a con
          siderable pile of corpses lying crosswise like
          sticks of wood, ana there were apparenUy
          fifty or sixty corpses remaining. This was in
          the cellar under the inner, vestibule, from
          where all the bodies taken out to-day were
          removed. They lay in a pile, apparenUy
          where they had been pitched into the cellar
          when tho floor and stairway gave way.
          When the panic occurred on Uie main floor
          of the theater, Thomas Rockford, chief usher
          of the establishment, was in the lobby. The
          performance was almost over, and he was
          about making arrangements for the depart
          ure of the audience. At the cnes of fire he
          aiished into the auditorium and endeavored
          to quiet Uie people who were about him, but
          peeing they were too thoroughly alarmed he
          vssxx. to the doors leading into flood's alley,
          which connects Johnson street and
          Myrtle avenue, and opened them
          eo that Uie people might escape
          in that way. Tliis diverted many from seek
          ing to escape through the main entrance. All
          who wcrq on the right-hand side of Uie par-
          3uette and balcony escaped through these
          oors. The opening of the doors created a
          tremendous draught, which so increased the
          flames Uiat the players were compelled to
          abandon the stage and escape as beat they
          might. They had remained there to
          the last, but, on seeing that it was
          a question of life and death, they
          retreated. The flames shot out on all sides
          of Uie stagc,.enveloping Uie proscenium, and
          the smoke began pouring in volumes into Uie
          parquette. Messrs. Studley and Murdoch
          were tho last to leave. Probably not more
          than five minutes elapsed between the begin
          ning of the panic and the complete envelop
          ment of the stage and parquette in flames.
          I3y this time nearly idl those in the lower
          part of tho house had escapcil, and
          the crowd from above canio pouring
          down into Uie lobbies, which were soon
          densely crowded and Uie stairways choked
          up, and there seemed to be no Svay in which
          they could be relieved. Many succeeded in
          escanintr bv Uie reeular means of eirress into
          Washington street, but that staircase was j
          also soon crowded, and escape by that way
          was next to impossible. The greatest loss of
          life must have oeen among those in the fam
          ily circle or top gallery. Those who hap
          pened to be seated near the ' doors
          succeeded in gaining the stairways and the
          lower part of Uie house, but there were many
          who got no further than the second floor,
          where they died. The flames made such
          rapid headway Uiat the floors fell in before
          assistance could reach them. The shrieks of
          women, Uie shouting and imprecations of
          men, and the pitiful cries of children were
          heard below, but there was no relief for them.
          Itwas'a heart-rending situatioa to have hu
          man beings perish almost in sight of their
          fellows; it was something terrible beyond
          description.
          As night approached two calcium lights
          were placed in position and the work of re
          moving the ghasUy forms of the dead, made
          more so by Uie light, was continued. They
          were under the galleries, but no estimate
          could be made of Uie number. The charred
          remains of the victims were taken out in front
          and the rear of the theater, and rapidlyjload
          ed in boxes and placed upon the undertaker's
          wagon; still the pile of bodies in Uie cellar
          did not seem to diminish.
          Although the fire originated on the stage,
          Uie loss ot life among Uie theatrical company
          was not as extensive as it might have been
          imagined. Two lives were lost two
          young men in the flower of their
          professional life Harry S. Murdoch and
          Claude Burroughs. These two young
          men were playing respecttvely "Pierre,
          thecripple, and "Picard,' valet to the "Chev
          alier. At the moment when the fire was
          discovered Murdoch was before the curtain
          playing with Miss Kate Claxton. As soon as
          the panic occurred, and a general rush
          was made to escape, Murdoch and
          Burroughs ran to their dressing-rooms
          to get their clothes to wear in the
          street, their garments being very scanty in
          the play. Their dressing-rooms were on the
          same bide of the stage, and the right whig
          as viewed from the auditorium, and conse
          quently furthest from the stage door. Even
          had that nie-.uis of exit not been locked
          by the panic-stricken janitor, the dressing
          rooms were arranged in tiers, .ap
          proached by a narrow stairway, which
          led up to the painter's bridge, which spans.
          Uie stage. Murdoch's room was on the sec
          ond tier, and Burrough's on the Uiird. Be
          fore they emerged, the stairway was one
          sheet of flame, so eagerly and so rapidly
          did the fire do its work that all chance ot re
          treat was cut off. The unfortunate men were
          driven back by the roaring flames step by
          step. Still, supposing in the agony of their
          peril that by some chance a means
          of descent from the other side of the
          bridge might offer, they ascended to ths
          trembling structure. Here they were
          last seen by J. II. Studley, a member of the
          company, who had left his dressing-room a
          few seconds before them and fought his way
          through the flames to a place of comparative
          safety, from which he was enabled to inakehis
          escape. Once on the bridge, their position
          was helpless. They could not descend by Uie
          way they came up, and there was no other
          means of escape but to leap.
          At half-past ten o'clock this evening the
          bodies of two men were digged from Uie
          ruins, and both were identified by the rem
          nants of their dresses wom on Uie stage.
          There were twelve hundred persons in the
          Uieater, five hundred of whom were in Uie
          galleries. This evening, notwithstanding Uie
          popularity of Miss Multon, the latest play at
          Uie Union Square Uieater, the proprietors
          ordered that Uie theater be closeed and a
          placard draped in mourning was placed at
          the entrance stating Uiat in consequence of
          the terrible disaster in Brooklyn there would
          be no performance this evening.
          At a late hour to-night two hundred and
          eighty-five boo ies had been recovered bjthe
          fire brigade.' 'iliss Kate Claxton loses ten
          thousand dc rs; Miss Ida "Vemon, eight
          thousand dollars, and Shook & Palmer, the
          lessees of tho Uieater, thirty thousand dol
          lars. The city authorities were in session to-day
          to make arrangements for the interment in
          Greenwood cemetery of the dead not iden
          tified. Tho Timet says: "Fire-Marshal Keady,
          who has made an exhaustive examination of
          the drcumitances. .attending the fire, is of
          opinion that at least three hundred and fifty
          persona perishedjn the flames . " i</text>

          roof al?ove, midway between tho lloor and the
          " lliee" or roof of the stage. At the back were two

          of the bliud orphan , The scene occupied the
          whole atage of the Brooklyn Theater. At the drop

          The Indescribable panic among the audience
          lasted psssibly ten minutes. Confusion CoBowed

          tboaght of the doors opening on the alley. The one
          in tie- lobby he succeeded in opening. It was a BJBtS
          of deliv.-ranee to many. A few gallant men en?
          deavored to ?picll the panic, but human effort was
          vain. In less than a minute the passages were
          choki'd up, the theater was tilled with ehouta of
          maddened men and the piteous and frantic serran?a
          of women. Men forirot that they were trampling
          on their fellows, and. inditlerent to all hut their
          o?\ n safety, scrambled upw ard and outward. Hus?
          band became separated from wife or child aud
          friend from friend. The parquet was quickly emp?
          tied of all save those few who must have been
          trampled down and sufibcuted near the lobby.
          The fire had spread witb astouishiug rapidity
          from the proscenium to the ceiling of the dome, and
          the black smoke, drawn by a draft like.a steady
          wind, roll??! in upotrthe galleries and added another
          terror to the gasping men and women who, ?till free
          from the jam on the stairway, droppeal to the par?
          quet floor to perish in the heat and smoke. There
          waa great peril and loss of life on tho lobby stairs
          leading to the dress circle. The stream of people
          lioweal on swiftly, crushing some, carrying othora
          out on shoulalers from tho dress circle until a stout
          lady caught her foot at tho lauding in the stair-rail
          and fell. The way was blocked. Crushed and
          maimed men wero pila-d one above the other. Three
          policemen, one of them stripping off his coat, extri
          cateal the lady anl opened the way again. Tho-se
          who coulai extricuto themselves ran over a masa of
          prostrate Wings to the door.
          The gallery was tilled by young men and boya
          Tlie BSOBBe of egress were by a siparate, angular
          stairway. Hero tie panic was worst. A few got
          out in the first rush. A jam occurred at the second
          landni- above the lobby, and tho staircase was bar
          rn ruled by an inextricable mass. .Some jumped
          over the stair-rail, others dropped into the parquet.
          I!i-foro those not killed outright and those
          belaud could free themselves the stairs gave
          way and all fell inte the lobby, whioh
          b. turn went ?town. It was a headlong fall, tha
          crushed and bleeding men and women and boye
          bounal and wound into a .solid mass, were suffocated
          by the weight Bnd But smoke, Those who escaped
          this awful death, bruised anal maimed, and with
          clothing torn, scarcely knowing .how they came
          forth, all thought that nolx.aly was left to perish.
          Kvou in all the outside confusion which ensued, it ia
          surprising that the loss of a singlo human life was
          discredited and not alc-finitely known till almost
          three hours slier the lire broke out. Tiie excitement
          was intciisilieil from morning till night of yesterday
          as the magnitiiale of the calamity enforced itself
          by the bitter evidence on men's minds. The scenes
          at the Morgue and the old market where the char
          mi remains were taken were terrible. By night?
          fall it was bcliarved that moro than a hundred
          boilie.-i wen- ret to Is? exhumed. The work was con?
          tinued by the light of torche- and lanterns. It wss
          broueht out in the examination, instituleal by Fire
          Marshal Keady, that there were no facilities on tha

          TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE.

          mains. Niw York, Dec . An extra ot a Brooklyn
          paper says that on tbe breaking out ofthe fire la
          the Brooklyn theatre (formerly Mrs. Conway's)
          last night, Mr. J. B. Stndley, who played the part
          of Jacques, made an effort to calm the excited
          audience. Stepping to the footlights, he said:
          "There's no trouble here; there'ls no fire. La
          dles aad gentlemen, keep your seats." Many of
          the auditors resumed their seats, but only for a
          few seconds. The flames spread rapidly. Miss
          Claxton.who was playing the part of Louise,
          the blind girl, showed great self-possession, as
          also did Mrs. Farren. They resolutely remained
          upon the stage Until the scenery at the left was
          completely licked up by the flames. Then the
          company rushed out Into Johnson street la stage
          costume, saving only the dresses they wore. Tne
          excitement In the audience was manifested la a
          stampede.
          TUX PASIO BECAME OETERAL
          before the actors left the stage, and a wild rush
          was made for the doors; womea shrieked, strug
          gled and fainted; men plunged over the seats and
          fought their way to the door. The aisles were
          blocked. The ushers made every effort to indueo
          the terrified mob to retire in good order. Ia thl
          they were seconded by the police officers In -tendance,
          but all to no purpose. In two mlrxtes
          tbe stage was one mass of flame; the heat was
          Intense. Many who occupied seats nearest the
          stage felt the scorching heat and sank txlpless to
          the floor. A moment sufficed to singe their hair,
          scorch their clothing and burn the flesh. A few
          minutes later and they were dragged out or the
          theatre In an Insensible condition by tbe police or
          tbe First precinct. Some or the actors sprang
          out into the auditorium ana trsc their chances in
          thestruggle for an exit by sne Washington-street
          or Flood-alley entrance. Mrs. Farren was
          among this number.
          several lives lost.
          Several lives are undoubtedly lost. Several
          women are believed to have been burned to a
          crisp. The body or one was recovered shortly be
          fore 3 o'clock this morning and sent to the hos
          pital In an ambulance. Two or three of the em
          ployees, who were engaged In the flies and shift
          ing scenes, are said to have perished la the
          flames. If every bit of scenery In the theatre
          had been drenched la kerosene the fire could not
          have spread more rapidly er furiously. Even
          before the first fire engine had responded the
          auditorium was
          A 8ZA OP PICE.

          "Two Orphans"and some valuable properties and
          costumes. Kate Olaxton loses a valuable ward
          robe. Mr. .George Butler, wTo resided In the
          theatre, loses several thousaaa dollars' worth. ot
          furniture and personal property. The total loss
          Is about (100,000. Miss Ida Vernon lost herward.

          storv or the bead usher.
          The head usher, who was standing In the lobby
          near the centre orchestra, says on hearing the
          alarm, and seeing that the flies over the stage on
          the left were on fire, he opened the Flood-alley
          entrance, and all who were in that part or the
          house escaped in this way. He thea came la iront
          again, and saw the occupants of the dress-circle
          pouring down the staircase. They came down by
          twenties; fell down, as It were. They trampled
          on each other. There was not much outcry. Be
          .got oa oae side to avoid the rush, and looked Into
          tne house again. By this time all the orchestra
          .performers had escaped, and the parquette and
          parquctte circle was clear. Tbe stage was now
          all la flames, and the fire was rapidly extending
          over the orchestra into the body of the house. The
          proscenium boxes on both sides were entirely
          ;one. The police removed a doien or twenty
          adtcs who had been thrown down by the rushing
          from the dress circle. Be thinks all were taken
          out, In a few minutes more the flames would
          have consumed them. Be'saw two men carried
          .out from the stage. A TMltee ameer who wan an
          'duty In the family circle says he heard acryoM

          All that could ba seen at this time was a few
          sparks railing down from the top scenery. The
          people were very much alarmed. Thea eame a

          wildly over the smaller ones. It took fully ten
          minutes to empty the dress circle, bat It seemed
          like an hour. Many men and women were In

          Numbers of women fainted, and we were obliged
          to carry them out. Fortunately there were few

          MISS CLAZTOn'S account.
          Miss Claxton testified before tho fire marshal
          this morning that at the beginning of tbe last
          act of the "Two Orphans," Just as the curtain
          went up, she heard a rumbling noise on the stage,
          and two minutes after she saw the flame. She
          thinks it caught la the fUts. It Immediately en
          veloped the stage. Mr. Stndley and Mr. ilur
          dock were on the stage together, and Mrs. Farren
          and mysolf.and efforts were made to quiet the
          audience. She said to them: "Be quiet: we are
          between you and the fire, the front doors are
          open, and the passages are clear." The flames
          were then sweeping down upon the four, and she
          ran out and down Into the audience and escaped.
          Mrs. Farren, Mr. Mnrdock and Mr. Stndley also
          joined In the effort to quiet the audience. No fire
          was used la the presentation ofthe play.
          MR. STUDLEY'S. STATELIEST.
          J. B. Stndley testified that he was oa the stage
          at the time of the Are, but he was Ignorant or its
          cause. Bis attention was directed to It by a res
          tlreness among the people at the back or the
          stage. Then he saw the flames over his head.
          Bow he made his way out he does not remember.
          He does not think that any or the actors are lost.
          The audience was pretty well thinned out or the
          lower part or the house when he left the stage,
          which ce believes he was the last to leave.

          The clothing was burned almost entirely off the
          body. Tbe physicians at first supposed the bedy to
          be that of a female', a silver watch and chain such
          as la worn by the other sex, however, decided the
          matter.
          The second body did not arrive until about 9
          o'clock. This was also a male; hands clasped, and
          on Ibe little linger or left was a plain silver ring.

          bave added to the Immense loss of life and resulted
          In the killing of more ladles and gentlemen of the

          B e hurriedly locked the stage door and kept back
          the astonished crowd by reiusingadmlttance or

          however, broke open the door and pushed him

          himself through the heart. The bodies of the two
          missing actors were found at 10:30 o'clock to-night.
          Murdoch's body was recognized by the velvet coat
          he wore, and that of Burrough's by the straps he
          wore. Tbe limbs and arms 01 Mr. Murdock's body

          the eflect or perceptibly reducing the- attendance at
          the theatres tn this city to-night. Union Square
          theatre was closed, and a placard, draped In mourn
          ing, was placed at tbe entrance, stating that In con
          sequence ot the terrible disaster In Brooklyn there
          would be no performance there this evening. The
          repoit that State Senator Henry C. Murphy was

        <text>APPALLING LOSS OF LIFE IN BROOKLYN,
          NEW YORK.
          The Paek Theater Buhs3 to the Gboijhd,
          While Filled With a Laeqe and Fashion
          able Audience.
          No Way of Escape and Wnole Families Porisa
          in tha Conflagration.
          Over Tnreo Hundred Bodies Taken from tie
          Smouldering Rains.
          The number of bodies thus far re
          covered from the ruins of the Park
          theater is about seventy-five, and it is
          believed as many more are still iu the
          ruins. They aro mostly thoso of the
          occupants of the family circle.
          The fire originated in the flies,which,
          blazing, fell on top of the scenery. One
          of the actresses camo to tho front of
          the stage and said : "A small accident
          has occurred, but don't bo alarmed,
          only a piece of fly on fire." On men
          tion of fire, tho audience arose to their
          feet and made a wild rush for the
          doors. The smoke 60on became suf
          focating, and women fell fainting in
          tho aisles, and were trampled over.
          Numbers jumped out of tho windows
          and were severely injured. Three
          were picked up and sent to Long
          Island College hospital, and are not
          exnected to live. A young mau, who
          jumped out of a window, says auother
          man was wnn mm aim got 10 me win
          dow, and, while holding on with his
          hands aud endeavoring to get out, be
          came overpowered with smoke, fell
          back, and must havo been consumed
          in the flames. Dresses were torn from
          ladies while lying in tho aisles aud on
          tho sidewalk outside. A large pile ot
          dresses so torn from their back', aud
          picked up by the police, were in the
          police station next door to the theater.
          All the theater company got out safely
          execot a fly-man named Cumberson,
          who wa3 badly burned and threw him
          self out of the window, lie will die.
          Dieter's restaurant i3 badly damaged
          by water, but not, as first rcportcd,do
          stroyed. The loss is mostly cohered
          by insurance
          "New York, Dec. 6. The fire iu the
          Brooklyn theater Ia3t night was at
          tended'by an appalling los3 of life,and
          it is thought not less than one hundred
          persons wero killed in the rush to the
          exits or burned to death, being unable
          to escape. The lire broke out during
          the performance of the last scenco of
          the "Two Orphans," in which Miss
          Claxton playes the heroine on the
          boat-house floor. Iu five minutes
          more tho audience would have been
          dismissed, and thero would have been
          nothing more serious than a destruc
          tion of property. Tho house was about
          two-thirds filled, those below sitting
          well forward toward the stage. For
          those in the family circle, dress circle
          and galleries thero was no way of es
          cape except on Washington street.
          The panic stricken people rushed pell
          mell toward aud down the stairways.
          The maiu exit became immediately
          choked up and a scene of terror, con
          fusion and distress ensued which beg
          gars description. Just above the land
          ing place of the stairway a woman, iu
          the crush, had her foot pushed between
          the banisters and fell. The crowd be
          hind, pressed by the terrified people
          still farther behind, fell over her aud
          piled on top of each other, four or five
          deep. The police from the station
          house next door were promptly at the
          scene, but owing to tho manner in
          which the people wero piled ou lop of
          each other and massed together, they
          could extricate comparatively few,and
          thc30 were all bruised, bleeding and
          maimed.
          Tho firemen got to work on the ruln3
          shortly after daylight this morning.
          They succeeded in getting a3 far as the
          dress circle, where they tound a (rest
          uumber of bodies and immediately be
          gan the work of removal, and up to 11
          o'clock sixty-five bodies had bien re
          covered, and what appeared to be
          twenty or thirty moro were seen in
          tho basement, "into which they had
          been precipitated by the falling of tha
          burning floor. At tho polico station,
          adjoining the burned theater, the
          names of cighty-3ix persons missing
          from their homes haye beeu registered.
          Kate Claxton, at the preliminary in
          quiry of Dro marshal, said that at tho
          beginning of the la3t act, "just as tho
          curtain went up, I heard a rumbling
          noise on the stage, and two minute-
          after I saw the flames. The fire seemed
          to be all on tho stage. Mrs. Farren,
          myself, Mr. Studley and Mr. Murdock
          were ou tho stage at this timo. We
          four remained there anil endeavored,
          a3 best we could, to quiet the audi
          ence and prevent n panic. I said to
          the people : 'Be quiet, we are be
          tween you and the fire. The front
          door is" onett, and the pas3ajre3 are
          clear.' Not one of the audience jumped
          on the stage. Tho flames wero then
          coming down on us. I rau out and
          jumped over several people. Mr. II.
          S. Murdock, after endeavoring to calm
          the fears of the panic stricken people,
          went to his dressing room to get his
          clothing and must havo been suf
          focated." The work of identifying tho dead
          will be difficult, for most of thom aro
          burned beyond recognition. The on
          ly mode ot identifying will be by per
          sonal property found nttached to tha
          bodies. Thtii far it U only evident
          that the 11 lines made common havoc
          with men, women and children. Short
          ly before nine o'clock Rev. Futher Han
          ley visited tho theater, and among the
          bodies recognize the brother of Rev.
          Father Kj lie. Father Kylie was pre
          sent and recognized the body of hi a
          brother. A body was taken from tLa
          ruins, charred and blackened beyond
          recognition. In the breast pocket of
          his coat wore a number of cards bear
          ing the name of Abraham Burnett iu
          German text.
          Bodies are cou3tanIy being removed
          from the ruins aud are taken to tlu
          morgue as fast as possible. It 13 ru
          mored that a number of tho attached
          of the theater aro burned. It seem
          certain that Charlc3 Lott and his sou,
          who were stationed in tho gallery, arc
          among tne lost. Tho actors aud ac
          tresses escaped front the stago into
          Johnson street.
          J. W. Thorp, stage manager, states
          that the fire occurred in this manucr:
          A drop was ignited from a border light
          by some means inexplicable, as ono
          was guarded from the other. He im
          mediately directed the stage carpenter,
          Mr. Weaver, and two supernumeraries
          to endeavor to extinguish the flame,
          but the difficulty was to reach the part
          ok fire. The stage carpenter with tho
          supernumeraries essayed to e fleet the
          object by lowering the drop, but in so
          doing added fuel to tho flames. Tho
          scene the hut iu the play embraced
          a ceiled apartment, audlheiustant tho
          burning drop came iu contact with tho
          inflammable ceiling it served to spread
          the flames in a flash, as though powder
          had previously been scattered about
          the scenery. Tho entire propertic3
          were iu a blaze. The usual avenues of
          escape were thus summarily closed at
          the rear, aud cxit,if ntall possible, had
          to be made by the way of tho boxen
          trance. All, except one or two, thii3
          escaped. It h now bcltvcd that tho
          uumber of the dead will bo about one
          hundred and twenty-live.
          Brooklyn, Dec. 6. Tho courts ad
          journed this morning without trans
          acting any business. There is intouso
          excitement iu the city, and busines3 is
          partially suspended. Park theatre has
          been cloied torn week. Wagon loads
          of rough boxes are arriving in front of
          the theatre. Corpses arc placed in
          them, and covered with tarpaulins and
          carried to the morgue. Tho scene
          grows more terrible every minute.
          Men and women are crowding around
          tho station-houe and theatre or en
          trance making inquiries for missing
          friends. In some instances whole fam
          ilies have perished. The bodies pre
          sent every form of contortion, just a
          thev stiffened iu that last agony when
          the floor gave away and they plunged
          down in blinding smoke and flames.
          Amsand leg3 are bent and twisted iu
          every way; hands arc clenched anu
          reached out as ! grasping for help.
          The Evening Posta.yi that at about
          11 o'clock a horriblo discovery was
          made. In the middle of what was the
          lobby of the theatre, lay an immense
          pile of rubbish smouldering beams,
          fragments of girders, aud other things
          this heap was nearly opposite the
          main entrance to the auditory of the
          theatre. Beyond it was another heap,
          marking the place where the stairs
          where the stairs which led to the gal
          lery fell. Under the heap first mention
          ed a dead body was found, aud tho
          firemen diligently prosecuted their
          search iu that direction. With much
          labor some of tho heaviest timber was
          removed, a horrible sight was reveal
          ed. Beucath that mound corpses lay
          in rows heaped ono upon the other,
          packed together with fearful solidity,
          which told of tho great pressure to
          which they had been subjected. How
          many lay there, what their sex or age.
          uo man could tell, aud at noon only
          guesses could be made. Another ac
          tor, Claude Burroughs, is now report
          ed missing. Thus far, but three
          corpses have been identified, thoso of

          Fleet Place.
          NewYokic Dec. 6. The Brooklyn
          Argus states that up to one o'clock 91
          bodies had been taken from the ruins
          aud others were still visible lying in
          layers four deep. The morgueis com
          pletely filled, and the bodies arc now
          carried to the old market building in
          Adam3 street. They can't bo recognized
          At two o'clock 115 bodies had been
          recovered, and there are probably as
          many more within the ruins. Somo
          persons assert that none in the upper
          gallery of the theater escaped. The
          last man that left the stairs says that
          behind him was a helpless, half suffo
          cated crowd.
          At four p. m. 175 bodies had been
          taken from the ruins of tho theater.
          The ruins arc still burning, making
          the work of removing the bodies very
          difficult. Flags are at half mast
          throughout the city aud the theaters
          arc draped mourning.
          Horror upon horror accumulate as
          the day advanced. Corpse after corpso
          charred and blackened, was passed
          out, and still tho pile of bodies in the
          cellar did not seem to dimish. As the
          number mounted up to 150 and 160 tho
          belief that the number would reach to
          200 grew into a certainty, and finally ,
          at half past four the two hundreth
          body was removed. Some were found
          with limbs and hands burned off, and
          nothing left but ghastly blackened
          trunk.
          At 5 o'clock the number had reached
          220. Twenty bodies were taken out
          iu half an hour. A look iuto the pit
          at this time still showed a considera
          ble number of corpses lying cro3swiso
          liko sticks of wood, aud there wcro
          apparently fifty or sixty more.
          This was in the cellar under the ves
          tibule, from where all the bodies taken
          out to-day were removed. They lay
          in a pile, apparently where thoy had
          beeu pitched into the cellar when the
          floor and stairway gave away,
          At a late hour to-night 235 bodies
          had been recovered. The fire marshal
          who has made an examination of the
          circumstances attending tho fire, is of
          the opinion that at least 350 persons
          perished in the flames.

        <text>One of many interesting objects is the monu
          ment erected by the city to the 138 identified bod
          ies from the great Brooklyn Theatre fire—278 were
          lost in that memorable conflagration—the remains
          of only 138 were identified. The cemetery com
          pany gave the lot and the city erected' the immense
          monument, Just why I can’t see. The arch at the
          main entrance cost $135,000 the receiving vault near
          by has a capacity of 1,500, the general keeping ot
          the enclosures is all that money can buy, the
          mounds—some four times as large as the State
          House at Columbia with their carpets of green
          have the appearance of being carpeted and are
          lovely to look upon. Funerals can be seen entering
          at all times,, from all sides. A visitor to New York
          will be amply repaid by visiting Greenwood and
          beholding its beauties,—particularly if he or she
          is one familiar with the history of the great per
          sons who have lived and moved prominently on
          the stage—the past 50 years.</text>
